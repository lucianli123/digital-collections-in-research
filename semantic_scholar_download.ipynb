       "usgs science for a changing world probabilistic seismic hazard maps of alaska by robert l wesson 1  arthur d frankel 1  charles s mueller1  and stephen c harmsen 1 openfile report 9936 1999 this report is preliminary and has not been reviewed for conformity with the us geological survey editorial standards or with the north american stratigraphic code any use of trade firm or product names is for descriptive purposes only and does not imply endorsement by the us government us department of the interior us geological survey 1 denver colorado abstract probabilistic seismic hazard maps have been prepared for alaska portraying ground motion values peak ground acceleration and spectral amplitude at periods of 0203 and 10 seconds at probabilities of exceedance of 2 and 10 in 50 years preparation of these maps followed the same general strategy as that followed for the usgs seismic hazard maps of the contiguous united states combining hazard derived from spatiallysmoothed historic seismicity with hazard from faultspecific sources preparation of the alaska maps presented particular challenges in characterizing the hazard from the alaska aleutian megathrust in the maps of the contiguous united states the rate of seismicity for recognized active faults was determined from slip rates estimated from geologic data this approach is not appropriate for the megathrust because it has been demonstrated that a significant fraction of the subduction occurs aseismically the characteristic earthquake hypothesis based on recurrence rates determined from geologic data is appealing for the portion of the megathrust that ruptured in the 1964 alaskan earthquake but is shown to be inappropriate for the western portion of the megathrust by the recent large earthquakes in the region which did not follow the characteristic model consequently the hazard from the western portion was estimated based on a truncated gutenberg and richter model derived from historic seismicity and the hazard for the 1964 zone was estimated from a combination of a gutenberg and richter model derived from historic seismicity and the characteristic earthquake hypothesis with recurrence rates estimated from geologic data owing to geologic complexity and limited data hazard models of the easternmost portion of the megathrust in the vicinity of yakataga are the least satisfactorily constrained hazard is estimated for the recognized crustal faults of the denali fairweatherqueen charlotte and castle mountain fault systems based on available geologic slip rates hazard from other sources is estimated from spatially smoothed historic seismicity disaggregations of the hazard for anchorage fairbanks and juneau reveal the dominant sources of the hazard at each location introduction alaska is the most seismically active state in the united states and in 1964 the site of one of the largest earthquakes since the beginning of instrumental recording although the current population of the region is small by comparison with say california the consequences of a large earthquake in the region could be much greater now than at the time of the 1964 alaskan earthquake the probabilistic seismic maps we have prepared are intended to extend those prepared by frankel et al 1996 for the 48 contiguous states and with soonto bepublished maps for hawaii our methodology follows the basic approach of cornell 1968 these maps are intended to summarize the available quantitative information about seismic hazard from geologic and geophysical sources full color maps at a scale of 17500000 are available as us geological survey miscellaneous investigations series 12679 wesson et al 1999 the process of preparing these maps included a workshop held in anchorage in the fall of 1996 attended by many scientists and engineers involved in aspects of earthquake research and structural engineering practice in alaska preliminary calculations of hazard were presented for discussion and a number of recommendations were made that affected the subsequent preparation of the map draft maps were posted on the world wide web and circulated for comment in the fall of 1997 the maps presented here have benefited greatly from both the original workshop in 1996 and from the review comments received the strategy for preparing these maps is similar to that for recently prepared seismic hazard maps of the contiguous united states frankel et al 1996 the maps presented here include maps for peak ground acceleration and 10 33 and 50 hz spectral acceleration at probabilities of exceedance of 10 in 50 years annual probability of 00021 and 2 in 50 years annual probability of 0000404 the historical instrumental seismicity of alaska and the aleutians for earthquakes greater than or equal to magnitude 6 is shown in figure 1 the preparation of the earthquake catalogs used for the analyses in this report and shown in figure 1 is discussed in a companion report mueller et al 1998 clearly the majority of the seismicity in the region is associated with the alaska aleutian megathrust fault extending eastward along the aleutian arc into south central alaska the northwestwardmoving pacific plate is subducted along this megathrust beneath the north american plate giving rise to the aleutian trench and islands additional significant seismicity occurs along the northwestward striking system of rightlateral strikeslip faults extending southeastward through and offshore of the panhandle of southeast alaska this system of faults forms the northeast boundary of the pacific plate additional seismicity occurs in central alaska the estimated rupture zones of the largest earthquakes in this century are shown in figure 2 plafker et al 1993 during this century virtually the entire plate boundary from the westernmost aleutian islands to the queen charlotte islands off british columbia has ruptured in large to great earthquakes the only exceptions are areas near the komandorsky islands near the shumagin islands and near cape yakataga sykes 1971 davies et al 1981 near the komandorsky islands historical records of large earthquakes in 1849 and 1858 at the extreme western end of the arc have been judged as insufficient to conclude that platemarginrupturing earthquakes have occurred there sykes et al 1981 taber et al 1991 at this location subduction is occurring at a highly oblique angle and it has been argued that the recurrence properties of large earthquakes here may differ significantly from those else along the arc indeed cormier 1975 has argued that the region may be incapable of supporting a great earthquake in the vicinity of the shumagin islands that is in the region between the 1957 and 1938 earthquakes it has been argued that no great earthquake has occurred in this century similarly the vicinity of cape yakataga has experienced no great earthquakes in this century these two regions have been identified as seismic gaps that is the potential sites of future large earthquakes davies et al 1981 sykes 1971 lahr et al 1980 characterization of seismic sources the seismic potential of alaska is captured through consideration of earthquake sources that can be explicitly identified including the alaskaaleutian megathrust and active crustal faults with known slip rates and earthquake sources that are characterized by spatially smoothed historical seismicity including shallow earthquakes from sources not included above and deeper earthquakes focal depths of 50 to 120 km hazard calculated from all these sources was combined as shown in figure 3 spatiallysmoothed seismicity was used to estimate the hazard from shallow crustal earthquakes in the magnitude range 50 to 73 based on a gutenbergrichter model for the deeper earthquakes hazard was estimated for the magnitude range 50 to 70 based on a gutenbergrichter model with the parameters estimated from the spatially smoothed seismicity in the two depth intervals 50 to 80 km and 80 to 120 km alaskaaleutian megathrust the alaskaaleutian megathrust has been responsible for several of the largest earthquakes known in instrumental seismology including the 1964 prince william sound mw 92 and 1957 aleutian mw 91 earthquakes figure 2 for purposes of this analysis two different segmentation models of the megathrust with corresponding recurrence assumptions have been considered segmentation models in the first segmentation model model i the megathrust has been divided into three parts as shown in figure 4 the western zone includes the reach of the megathrust along the western and central aleutians from about 1702 e to 1617 w the eastern zone extends eastward and includes the reach along the eastern aleutians the alaska peninsula and prince william sound from about 1617 w to 1442 w finally the yakataga zone extends further to the east across the copper river delta to yakutat that is to about 1395 w in view of the uncertainties in the earthquake potential in the region of the komandorsky islands no segment of the megathrust was explicitly modeled west of 1702 e these boundaries are interpreted to be the limits of the possible rupture surfaces of significant earthquakes associated with the megathrust in the second segmentation model of the megathrust model ii shown in figure 5 four segments are considered this model is similar to the first in that the western zone in model i generally corresponds to zone a in model ii and the yakataga zones in the two models are identical the primary differences between models i and ii arise in the region between the eastern aleutians and prince william sound in model ii the eastern zone of the model i is divided into zones b and c the portion of the eastern zone that ruptured in the 1964 earthquake is identified as zone c and the remainder including the portions of the eastern zone that ruptured in the 1938 earthquake and that portion between the 1938 and 1957 earthquake ruptures are included in zone b it seems reasonable to conclude that an earthquake of magnitude 92 is the maximum to be expected from the megathrust but it is not clear whether the potential for an earthquake of this magnitude extends throughout the eastern zone of model i that is as far west as the limit of the continental crust near 1617 w or whether this potential is limited the rupture area of the 1964 earthquake the occurrence of the 1938 earthquake mw 82 off the lower alaskan peninsula argues that the behavior of this portion of the region may not be characteristic with a magnitude of 92 model ii is intended to that this possibility into account confining the characteristic magnitude 92 to the 1964 aftershock zone in model i the boundary between the western and eastern zones and in model ii the boundary between zones a and b is taken as the approximate limit of continental crust north of the aleutian arc this segment boundary was suggested by several participants at our workshop specifically we set the boundary at the eastern edge of the 1946 earthquake the selection of this boundary is based on the assumption that it is extremely unlikely that a large earthquake could rupture through this region a consequence of prohibiting rupture through a boundary is that the calculated hazard shows a saddle in the region of the boundary the saddle occurs because the hazard is calculated from a sequence of floating rupture zones that are offset incrementally along the megathrust because no rupture zones are allowed to cross the segment boundary a site at the end of the segment is immediately adjacent to only one floating rupture and is at increasing distances from all other floating ruptures as they are offset along the megathrust in contrast higher hazard is calculated at the center of a segment where a site is immediately adjacent to many floating rupture zones reviewers objected to the presence of the saddle but were unwilling to abandon the concept of a segment boundary in this region to resolve this incompatibility in model i the western and eastern zones were allowed to overlap by 200 km the resulting hazard is generally constant along the strike of the megathrust through this region the eastern limit of the eastern zone is taken to be the approximate eastern limit of the aftershocks of the 1964 earthquake and of the welldefined alaskaaleutian benioff zone the western boundary of the western zone is taken as the western limit of the 1965 rat islands earthquake rupture zone approximately 170 e although a variety of more detailed segmentation models have been proposed for the megathrust zone large earthquakes particularly in the western and central aleutians notably the 1986 earthquake mw 80 near adak island have tended to occur without particular regard for the proposed boundaries the southern or updip boundaries of the western and eastern zones in model i and zones a b and c in model ii are defined by the so called seismic front that is the presumed updip limit of that part of the megathrust capable of producing a significant earthquake the seismic front is generally defined by the southern limit of wellrecorded seismicity engdahl written communication 1997 and by the break in slope at the lower edge of the shelf on the northern side of the aleutian trench this break approximately follows the 400 m depth contour cf plafker et al 1993 the updip boundary is taken to be at a depth of 20km the northern or downdip boundaries of the western and eastern zones except in the area of the alaskan peninsula and cook inlet is taken as the 50 km depth contour of earthquakes in the benioff zone plafker et al 1993 boyd et al 1995 observed that standard earthquake locations in the central and western aleutians are biased as much as several 10s of km to the north owing to the influence of early arrivals at seismograph stations in europe to which wave propagation is along anomalously highvelocity paths down the subducting slab in considering the appropriate northern boundaries of the zones hypocenters of earthquakes relocated by engdahl written communication 1997 were compared with the map and depth contours of plafker et al 1993 and found to be in good agreement in the eastern alaskan peninsula and cook inlet regions the aftershocks of the 1964 earthquake did not extend as far downdip or north as the 50 km contour and the boundary was taken as the approximate northern limit of the aftershocks of the 1964 earthquake plafker et al 1993 in this region the boundary was assumed to lie at a depth 40 km between about 1550 w and 1592 w the depth to the boundary increases smoothly westward from 40 to 50 km the assumption about the location of the downdip or northern limit of the megathrust in the cook inlet area is important because it significantly affects the estimation of hazard in the area of anchorage although the yakataga segment is clearly the location of significant north south convergence and the site of very large earthquakes eg 1899 1979 the details of the faulting are poorly understood several easttrending north dipping thrust faults are inferred to exist beneath the heavily glaciercovered region as a proxy for a more detailed understanding a flat fault surface that is with a 0 dip at a depth of 15 km was assumed extending from 591 to 610 n and from 1395 to 1454 w recurrence assumptions although the rate of convergence across the alaskaaleutian megathrust is relatively well known the fraction of the convergence that is accommodated by large earthquakes is significantly less than one this fraction varies with position along megathrust zone but is poorly known it appears to range from 10 or less to near 100 cf pacheco et al 1993 thus estimates of the rate of large earthquakes based on the known convergence rate alone are unrealistically large well above the observed rate of large earthquakes over the last century other than the plate convergence rate the only data available to estimate recurrence along the entire megathrust is the instrumental seismicity catalog at present geologic data for recurrence exists only for the 1964 zone plafker and rubin 1994 estimate that seven or eight events with displacements similar to 1964 are reflected in the stratigraphic sequence in the copper river delta in the 5600 years preceding 1964 these data suggest a recurrence time for earthquakes of magnitude 92 of 700 to 800 years the occurrence of the 1938 earthquake mw 82 off the lower alaskan peninsula indicates that very large earthquakes with magnitudes less than 92 occur as well therefore one must ask the question what is the largest earthquake that might have occurred within the 1964 zone but would not be reflected in the stratigraphy of the copper river delta our estimate is that an earthquake with a magnitude as large as 8 could occur without causing sufficient vertical displacement in the region of the copper river delta to be reflected in the stratigraphy in view of the limited geologic data recurrence assumptions for most of the megathrust are based on instrumental seismic data hazard was estimated assuming a gutenbergrichter recurrence model for magnitude 70 to 92 in the western zone of model i and zone a of model ii similarly a gutenberg richter recurrence model was assumed for magnitudes 70 to 85 in zone b of model ii for magnitudes of 70 to 8 in the eastern zone of model i and zone c of model ii and for magnitudes 70 to 81 in the yakataga zone the parameters a and b in the gutenbergrichter relations was estimated in each of these regions from the historical seismicity data in addition a characteristic earthquake of magnitude 92 with a recurrence time of 750 years was assumed for the eastern zone of model i and for zone c of model ii smaller earthquakes hazard for earthquakes in the magnitude range 50 to 70 was calculated from a gutenbergrichter recurrence relation determined for each of the megathrust source zones a and b values were determined for each of the source zones of the megathrust these seismicity parameters were determined from maximumlikelihood fits of log n versus magnitude for shallow events greater than magnitude 45 the minimum magnitude of completeness in the region since 1964 hazard was calculated using the flvalue and frvalue for each zone no smoothing was applied to the edges of these source zones details may be found in the companion report by mueller et al 1998 active crustal faults although considerable information is available about a few active crustal faults in alaska there are certainly many more faults with unknown slip rates faults included explicitly in the map are shown in figure 6 note that the seismic hazard associated with faults not explicitly included in the map is captured to a large degree by the smoothed seismicity model described below to be included in this map a fault must have an estimated slip rate as in our treatment of western us faults in the national maps frankel et al 1996 we divide the faults into two types a characteristic and b hybrid the atype faults are faults with known segmentation we use a characteristic rupture model for the atype faults in which rupture occurs only as the largest earthquake estimated for each fault segment btype faults have unknown segmentation so we use two equallyweighted recurrence models for these hybrid faults we calculated hazard using 50 weight for the characteristic earthquake model and 50 weight for a truncated gutenbergrichter frequency magnitude relation we used a minimum magnitude of m65 and a maximum magnitude of mchar for the gutenbergrichter hazard calculation in general the gutenbergrichter recurrence model yields higher hazard for a given fault than the characteristic model because of the more frequent occurrence of moderate sized earthquakes in the gutenbergrichter model use of this model is intended here to account for the possibility that the crustal faults will rupture in segments smaller than their entire length recurrence times characteristic and a values gr for the each fault were determined from their slip rates not from the seismicity surrounding the fault characteristic magnitudes were determined from fault lengths using the relations of wells and coppersmith 1994 see frankel et al 1996 for the formulas deriving the a values and characteristic earthquake rates from the geologic slip rate and area of fault the fault widths of crustal faults were estimated by assuming a maximum faulting depth of 15 km these crustal faults were taken to be vertical except for the castle mountain fault dips 75 to north and the transition fault dips 10 to north table 1 identifies the faults and fault segments included in the map and the assumptions made about them the slip rates are from nishenko and jacob 1990 and plafker et al 1993 except as noted below the recurrence times in the table are for the characteristic earthquakes again the hybrid faults also use a gutenbergrichter recurrence model which will produce more frequent recurrence for earthquakes between m65 and mchar estimates of the slip rate for the totschunda fault ranged from 8 to 15 mmyr plafker et al 1993 we adopted a mean value of 115 mmyr we note that we treated the transition fault as an atype fault even though its segmentation is unknown in initial hazard calculations using a hybrid approach for this fault we found that the transition fault produced the highest hazard in the map the slip rate of the transition fault is highly uncertain j lahr pers comm and we were concerned that one of the more poorly known faults had a higher hazard than the megathrust zone consequently we used only the characteristic rupture model for the transition fault which produces a lower hazard than the hybrid approach also we used the youngs et al 1997 subduction zone interface attenuation relation when estimating ground motions for the transition fault see attenuation section below this produces somewhat lower ground motions than do attenuation relations for crustal earthquakes of particular interest is the castle mountain fault passing about 40 km from anchorage the fault has been considered in two segments the western or susitna segment and the eastern or talkeetna segment detterman et al 1994 along the talkeetna segment there is no evidence for surficial displacement younger than pleistocene detterman et al 1976 but lahr et al 1986 describe an earthquake of ms 52 which indicated slip at a depth of 13 to 20 km along the segment in contrast along the susitna segment no significant earthquakes have been instrumentally located but geologic studies indicate holocene surface displacement detterman et al 1974 1976 bruhn 1979 these studies however have served only to put wide limits on the slip rate we chose a value of 05 mmyr and a maximum magnitude of 75 leading to a recurrence time of 1300 years r updike oral communication 1997 determination of seismicity parameters from spatiallysmoothed seismicity for the smoothed seismicity calculation the shallow events focal depth 50 km in the areal source zones of the megathrust were first removed from the catalog next the catalog was divided into shallow deep focal depth 5080 km and deeper focal depth 80 to 120 km events frvalues were determined separately for the shallow deep and deeper events using the maximum likelihood method weichert 1980 for events with magnitudes greater than 45 we found bvalues of 087 for the shallow seismicity 12 for the deep seismicity 5080 km depth and 115 for the deeper seismicity 80120 km depth using the approach of frankel 1995 avalue grids were calculated using the maximumlikelihood formula from weichert 1980 these 0value grids were then smoothed with gaussian smoothing functions correlation distance of 75 km and the hazard was calculated by summing the frequencies of exceedance for all of the grid cells this was done separately for the shallow and two deep cases these avalue grids were then used as the basis to calculate the hazard arising from earthquakes in the magnitude range 50 to 70 50 to 73 for the shallow case source finiteness in hazard calculation in all the calculations of hazard the treatment of source finiteness varied with magnitude range for events between m50 and m65 we assumed point sources for events from m65 to m70 m65 to m73 in the case of shallow earthquakes we used finite faults of arbitrary strike for events greater than magnitude 70 in the megathrust zone we used floating rupture zones offset incrementally along the megathrust for the crustal faults when using the gutenbergrichter recurrence model we floated the rupture zones along the fault the floating rupture zones along the crustal faults and the megathrust cause a tapering of the hazard at the ends of the faults attenuation relationships the reference site condition is the nehrp bc boundary which corresponds to an average shearwave velocity of 760 msec in the top 30m this is the same site condition used in the 1996 national maps this site condition represents a typical western us firmrock site table 2 shows the ground motion relationships used in the calculations these are the same relations used in producing the 1996 hazard maps for the western us for crustal faults we used different ground motion values for thrust faults and for strikeslip faults using the values specified in each attenuation study for the deep earthquakes we assumed a focal depth of 60 km for earthquakes in the depth interval 50 to 80 km and a focal depth of 90 km for earthquakes in the depth interval 80 to 120 km discussion of maps probabilistic seismic hazard maps for alaska calculated as described above are shown in figures 710 for peak ground acceleration 50 33 and 1 hz spectral acceleration and for 10 and 2 probability of exceedance in 50 years hazard is highest in the coastal regions adjacent to the megathrust and the transition fault and in regions adjacent to the denali and fairweatherqueen charlotte fault systems at all periods and probability levels in the interior of alaska away from the denali fault hazard is dominated by the spatially smoothed seismicity the region of lowest hazard in alaska is along the northern coast adjacent to the arctic ocean the hazard associated with the castle mountain fault is overwhelmed by the megathrust at most periods and probability levels but can be seen on the map of peak ground acceleration with 2 probability of exceedance in 50 years figure 7b in general hazard in the higher hazard regions of alaska is comparable to areas of higher hazard in california frankel et al 1996 disaggregations by magnitude and distance to the source of the hazard are shown in figures 11 12 and 13 for anchorage fairbanks and juneau for peak ground acceleration and 5 hz and 1 hz spectral acceleration at the 2in50 year probability level the disaggregation plots include the summary joint distribution statistics the mean magnitude and distance mbar and dbar and the modal magnitude and distance mmode and dmode the disaggregations for anchorage indicate the role of great earthquakes magnitude 9 at a distance of about 50 km relative to the other sources figure 11 the relative contribution of the great earthquakes increases with increasing period decreasing frequency until the great earthquakes dominate at a 10 frequency of 1 hz on these plots hazard from the castle mountain fault at a distance of about 40 km is combined with the hazard from earthquakes in the magnitude range up to 75 on the megathrust the other significant contributions to the hazard arise from the shallow smoothed seismicity shown at a distance of about 20 km and the two deeper zones of smoothed seismicity  show at distances of 60 and 90 km the disaggregations for fairbanks figure 12 show that the hazard is dominated by local earthquakes the influences of the denali fault at distance of about 135 km and the megathrust at a distance of about 350 km are only apparent on the disaggregation for 1 hz the disaggregations for juneau figure 13 show the relative contributions of the local shallow seismicity and large earthquakes on the south denali chatham strait fault at a distance of about 80 km the relative contribution of the large earthquakes on the south denali increase with increasing period decreasing frequency although somewhat more detailed the current maps for peak ground acceleration are generally similar to the maps prepared by thenhaus et al 1985 for the corresponding probability levels although significant differences do exist thenhaus et al did not estimate the hazard in the area of the aleutian islands in general the values on the current map for the 10in50year probability level are somewhat lower than those on the thenhaus et al map in south central and southeast alaska but somewhat higher in the offshore regions above and adjacent to the megathrust the values on the current 2in50year map are similar to those on the thenhaus et al map in south central and southeast alaska but somewhat higher in the offshore regions above and adjacent to the megathrust for example for the anchorage area at the 10in50year probability level the current map indicates a peak ground acceleration of 37 g in contrast to about 45 for the thenhaus et al map at the 2 in 50 year probability level the current map indicates about 65 g for the anchorage area as contrasted with 67 g on the thenhaus et al map table 3 compares estimates of the estimated peak ground accelerations from the current maps and the thenhaus et al maps at nine locations in alaska conclusions and issues requiring future work alaska has some of the areas of highest seismic hazard in the united states in contrast to california where most of the regions of highest hazard occur in relatively narrow zones and are often associated with nearly vertical faults most of the hazardous regions in alaska occur in association with relatively shallow dipping faults leading to much larger affected areas the principal sources of seismic hazard in alaska are the alaskaaleutian megathrust and the transition fault both relatively shallow dipping and affecting very large areas and the fairweather queen charlotte and denali faults near vertical faults leading to relatively narrow zones of high hazard 11 obviously there are many aspects of the methodology and input information that can be debated in constructing these maps we have attempted to include those elements of geologic and geophysical information and interpretation for which a community consensus exists we have also attempted to indicate explicitly those areas where we have been forced to rely on judgment or assumption future seismic hazard maps would benefit from additional information in several areas additional understanding of the characteristics of faulting in subduction zones especially the 1964 zone would be very helpful tectonic understanding of the region between the 1964 zone and the fairweather fault including the yakataga gap and the transition fault would be extremely valuable more measurements of slip rates on the crustal faults are needed finally new insights into the segmentation of the megathrust and the expected magnitude distribution of earthquakes would have a large impact specific methodological issues that warrant further consideration include 1 segmentation boundaries on faults characterized by large earthquakes cause saddles in hazard with lower hazard near boundary because of the tapering of hazard caused by floating rupture zones we dealt with this saddle in the hazard in an ad hoc manner by overlapping the zones this issue requires additional consideration over the long run 2 we used historical seismicity rather than convergence rates to establish rates of large m7 earthquakes in the megathrust source zones it would be desirable to rationalize the seismicity rates with the convergence rate through some quantitative mechanism 3 future segmentation models for the megathrust could benefit greatly from additional tectonic insight 4 use of timedependent probabilities acknowledgments we thank the participants of the september 1996 workshop on seismic hazard mapping in alaska for their valuable

uncertainties of the length slip rate and other seismic characteristics of the fault a lower value of 75 was adopted because this lower estimate leads to more frequent earthquakes and thus higher

structural damage and destruction liquefaction landslide flood lifeline damage and obstruction etc recent gorkha earthquake on 25th april 2015 of magnitude 78m with another strong aftershock of magnitude 73m caused about 9000 deaths 22000 injuries with loss of billions of dollars is one of the clear example of devastation during the hazard to mitigate such hazard there is not any other alternative left for professionals rather than making the structures earthquake resistant for the design of seismic resistant structures it is essential to do site specific seismic hazard analysis and to quantify the site specific ground motion parameters this necessitates the probabilistic seismic hazard analysis for the whole country so an attempt has been made to carry out probabilistic seismic hazard analysis of the country and the result is presented in the form of contour map for pga and spectral accelerations earthquake catalogue 78 80 82 84 86 88 90 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 m41m5 m51m6

relationships mcguire 2004 and scaling relationship for himalayan region ambraseys and douglas 2004 the earthquake record contains large number of aftershocks which if not removed leads the earthquake data to be a non poissoinian this makes the statistical analysis more complicated hence the aftershocks are removed based on windowing algorithm given by gardner and knopoff 1974for this the aftershocks are identified based on its distance from epicenter of main shock and time difference in occurrence with main shock the catalogue after the aftershock removal follows poissoinian distribution there are total 1228 records available among them 827 events are found to be the main events completeness analysis it is very difficult to allocate the location of earthquake occurrence and more than this it is difficult to specify which earthquake belongs to which fault the recorded earthquake data has non uniformity in its number due to the difficulty in availability of data of old times hence it is necessary to do the completeness analysis for the best fit of frequency formula and it can be done as per stepp 1972 for the earthquakes events are grouped into small intervals of time and each magnitude range 05m is judged separately if 1k  2 k  3 k  n k are the number of earthquakes per unit time interval then an unbiased estimate of the mean rate per unit time interval of the sample is    n i i m k n 1 1  equation 1 the variance of the sample is given by n m m     2 equation 2 where n number of unit time intervals if we assume number of unit time intervals as 1 year then standard deviation of the estimate of the mean t m m     equation 3 where t  sample length thus assuming stationarity we expect that m behaves as t 1 in the subinterval of the sample in which the mean rate of occurrence t n in each magnitude class constant where n  cumulative number of earthquakes in the time interval t the completeness analysis as done above gives the best fit for the magnitude frequency relation in this case the magnitude frequency relationship for all the four areas of nepal is obtained 201 journal of innovation in engineering education vol 2 issue  1 march 2019 probabilistic seismic hazard analysis psha spatial uncertainty due to uncertainty in location and nature geometry of the source it is very much difficult to define the source zone in this study the area is divided into 528 numbers of smaller areal elements of size 05 along longitude and 025 along latitude all the sources are assumed to be equally capable of producing earthquake and the occurrence will be in the centre of each areal cell magnitude uncertainty to address the uncertainty in magnitude produced by each source zone various recurrence relationships specifying the average rate at which an earthquake of some size will be exceeded is to be developed thus obtained magnitude frequency relationship may accommodate the maximum size earthquake the recurrence relation as per gutenberg and richter is equation 4 where m   mean annual rate of exceedence of magnitude m 10a  mean yearly number of earthquakes of magnitude greater than or equal to zero b  relative likelihood of large and small earthquakes as b value increases the number of larger magnitude earthquake decreases compared to those of smaller magnitude earthquakes the standard gutenbergrichter law predicts the nonzero mean rate of exceedences for magnitudes up to infinity we are concerned with the earthquake greater than magnitude m45 since greater size earthquake produces maximum level of shaking generally so bounded recurrence relation law is used to express the certain maximum magnitude mmax associated with each source zone the value of which is greater than minimum magnitude mmin  the probability

attenuation of ground motion the seismic hazard at any area depends upon the attenuation characteristics of that site which is the function of magnitude of earthquake source to site distance and geologic characteristics of the site or tectonic environment proper implementation of most modern ground motion attenuation relationship requires that the seismic sources are characterized by the details of the fault  rupture model there are the various attenuation relationships developed by researchers at different site condition as nepal lies in the subduction zone the attenuation laws developed for subduction zone is used to to develop the peak ground acceleration pga and spectral acceleration sa so three attenuation relationships developed for subduction zone have been used here

hazard curve the plot of mean annual rate of exceedence versus peak ground acceleration gives the seismic hazard curve the seismic hazard curve for individual source zone is obtained at first and they are combined to get the hazard for the particular site  the probability of exceedence of certain ground motion is estimated by assuming probability distribution of ground motion the probability of exceedence of certain ground motion parameter y than the particular value y is calculated for one possible earthquake at one possible source location is multiplied by the probability that the particular magnitude earthquake will occur at the particular location this process is repeated for all possible magnitudes and locations with the probabilities of each summed for a given earthquake occurrence the probability that a ground motion parameter y will exceed particular value y can be computed by using total probability theorem ie equation 14 where x  a vector of random variable that influences y in most cases quantities in term x are limited to the magnitude m and distance r assuming m and r are independent the probability of exceedence can be written as equation 15 where    mr y

as it is explained in previous sections seismic hazard from faults cannot be estimated as it is done in conventional methods if there is the lack of recognizable earthquake faults and seismically active geologic structure in any area then uniform density model is adopted in such model the earthquake densities are equally distributed in all areas weather there is earthquake or not maximum

paleoseismologic data and interpretations if available or simply from the judgments of experts uniform density model forgets faulting and assumes uniform geology and gives the equal weightage to all

hazard analysis pga rcrisis 1 introduction the danger posed to civilization by devastating earthquakes in many regions of the globe is sufficient justification for evaluating the seismic hazards of earthquakes while constructing buildings and infrastructures 123 as a result of the regions high seismic activity a number of researchers have evaluated the seismic hazard of several areas in southwest turkey 45678 the burdur basin and its environs are situated in a region that has seen high seismic activity over both the historical and instrumental periods 9 on october 3 1914 and may 12 1971 there were two large earthquakes both events created extensive damage the earthquake that occurred on october 3 1914 ms70 was the largest of the two killing about 4000 people and demolishing 90 percent of burdurs residences the may 12 1971 incident ms62 produced more localized devastation and resulted in the deaths of 57 persons these events caused surface fault ruptures 10 western turkey situated at the eastern extremity of the aegean extensional province represents one of the biggest instances of active continental expansion 11 numerous academics have examined the western anatolia tectonic area to determine the relationship between relative plate motions and complicated tectonic features the horstgraben system in this region which comprises the edremit bakray ktahya simav gediz kk menderes byk menderes and gokova grabens is considered to be one of the most active extensional tectonic structures in the world with an average gps velocity of 20 mmyr 12 burdur city center is

alluvium when the tectonic environment of the city is considered together with its geotechnically unfavorable situation the seismic vulnerability increases in the present research seismic hazard study was conducted for burdur city using a probabilistic approach western anatolia wa between 34 and 40 n latitudes and 26 and 33 e longitudes was considered as seismic study region for the evaluation of seismic hazards 2 method 21 seismicity model the modified gutenbergrichter seismicity model 13 that is related to poissonian occurrences was applied in the probabilistic seismic hazard analysis psha computations using the rcrisis v18 14 program the phase of intensity exceedance maintains the poissonian procedure together with the poissonian occurrences according to the poissonian procedure the possibility that an intensity would above  certain level during the next  years becomes as follows pr    1  exp 1 where  is the exceedance frequency of intensity  if an event of magnitude  occurs at a hypocenter distance  from the chosen site the modified gutenbergrichter seismicity model predicts that the chance of hazard intensity above  threshold in the next  years will be estimated by the following formula 7    1  exp   2 where   is the exceedance probability of the hazard intensity  assuming that an earthquake of magnitude  occurred at a hypocenter distance  from the point of interest the poissonian magnitude exceedance frequency  is determined by the magnitude range that magnitude m defines as in eq 3     ab c d    eb c d 3 the modified gutenbergrichter model 15 gives the eq 4 for the exceedance frequency of the earthquake magnitude m   f ghiajaghiajklm ghiajknoaghiajklm  pqr    ptu 4 where pqr is the threshold earthquake magnitude and f is the exceedance frequency of the pqr  represents a seismicity parameter equal to the natural logarithm of b value and ptu denotes the predicted maximum earthquake magnitude for the seismic source 22 earthquake data and seismic source zones the first step in this psha is creating an earthquake catalog for the region that is homogenized and declustered and identifying of the seismic sources that may produce ground motions at the region the seismicity of wa was studied by different researchers they suggested different zonation models related to wa in this study the zonation model containing 15 seismic regions m alpyrr 93 suggested by bayrak and bayrak 16 is used earthquake epicenter distribution and seismic sources are shown in figure 1 fig1 location of earthquake epicenters and 15 main seismic sources in sw turkey in this study only instrumental shallow earthquake h  70 km data was used the earthquake data from 1900 to 2005 was obtained from kalafat et al 17 and the data from 2005 to 2020 was obtained from the earthquake catalog of the disaster and emergency management presidency of turkey data homogeneity is essential to the analysis for this reason the following magnitude conversion equations provided by akkar et al 18 were utilized to convert different magnitude scales including body wave magnitude mb surface wave magnitude ms local magnitude ml and duration magnitude md to moment magnitude mw in order to achieve magnitude scale homogeneity   057160024927  249800117197 34    54 5   081260034602  117230208173 55   6   103190025  002230130 7   079470033  134200163 8   080950031  130030154 9 the completeness of the earthquake data is another important criterion for the analysis in other words the catalog must contain all of the events with magnitudes greater a specific minimum cutoff magnitude mc that occurred in a particular seismic source over a particular time m alpyrr 94 period the selection of the main shocks from the earthquake catalog is another basic consideration for usage in the gutenbergrichter equation the catalog must be free of all after and forshocks for this reason these dependent events after and forshocks were exluded from the catalog using reasenbergs 19 declustering approach in this study mc a and b parameters were determined using the zmap v7 software developed by wiemer 20 where the maximum likelihood method suggested by aki 21 is applied the gutenbergrichter recurrence relationship was utilized to assess the seismicity of the seismic sources this well known equation has the following general form      10 where nm cumulative frequency is the number of earthquakes equal or larger than m magnitude the magnitudefrequency relations variables a and b denote constants the average yearly seismic activity index is defined by value a which is dependent on the observation period and the seismic activity the slope of the linear function is provided by parameter b which relates to the physics of earthquakes it is essential to understand how ground motions attenuate with distance in order to assess the seismic risk at a given location this statement often known as the law of attenuation connects magnitude distance and seismic intensity the impact of the earthquakes size will be lessened by the larger the distance between the rupture area and the location where the risk is assessed 22 usually empirical attenuation relationships in other words ground motion prediction equations gmpe constrain how pga values reduce with distance the turkish earthquake database is largely dominated by 1999 kocaeli and dzce earthquakes with lower intensities there are no seismological indications that this pattern will be endorsed by potential large magnitude occurrences 23 hence gmpes derived from global database were preferred in this study

30 are examined with different earthquake scenarios and ask14 cb14 and cy14 models were selected according to the results shown in figure 2 for hazard computation rcrisis v18 software was used this program complies to the cornell 31 approach this technique integrates the effect of all probable seismic sources assigns their average activity rate and then analyzes the seismic hazard at the location of interest the creation of hybrid gmpe models with selected gmpes and assigned branch weights constitutes the final stage of the analysis after examining 7 gmpes chosen for active shallow crustal earthquakes 3 of them ask14 cb14 and cy14 were selected for hybrid model hm applications and 6 different hybrid gmpe models were created as shown in table 1 table 1 hybrid models and weights

84 1 introduction 85 india faces several threats from various natural hazards such as flood drought landslide cyclone earthquake 86 tsunami etc earthquake is one of the most serious devastating natural hazards which occur beneath the ground 87 4 surface and release a huge amount of energy it causes extensive damage like the collapse of the structure 88 massive loss of life triggering a fire landslides or tsunami high seismic activity in india fig 1 is clearly 89 evident from the recent major earthquakes ie nepal earthquake in 2015 mw75 sikkim earthquake in 2011 90 mw67 kashmir earthquake in 2005 mw76 bhuj earthquake in 2001 mw77 latur earthquake in 1993 91 mw62 the presence of high seismic strain gap in the himalayan region has been documented by kumar et 92 al 2013a which may cause more devastating earthquakes in the near future the himalayan subduction zone 93 is the second most seismically active zone after the san andreas fault in the world where the earthquakes are 94 caused due to the thrust faulting and the earthquake focal depths vary from shallow to about 200 km due to the 95 everincreasing demand for structural growth fuelled by increasing population near himalayan belt and indo 96 gangetic basin the need for seismic hazard analysis estimation of the peak ground acceleration and the site 97 specific response spectra have gained importance for designing buildings infrastructure projects as well as 98 disaster planning and management 99 seismic hazard analysis is very important for the safe construction of seismic resistance structure 100 based on regional seismological and geological evidence the seismic hazard analysis can be evaluated using 101 two methods deterministic seismic hazard analysis dsha and probabilistic seismic hazard analysis psha 102 burnwal et al 2017 documented deterministic seismic hazard analysis dsha and presented the peak ground 103 acceleration pga values for the sitamarhi area near the biharnepal region the dsha considers just one 104 maximum magnitude and distance scenario bommer and abrahamson 2006 but the seismic hazard at a site is 105 influenced by all the seismic sources with different magnitudes and distances the widely used approach to 106 estimate seismicdesign loads for engineering projects is probabilistic seismichazard analysis psha the 107 psha consists of four steps reiter 1990 i identification and characterization of earthquake sources 108 contributing to the seismic hazard of a study area ii seismicity or temporal distribution of earthquake 109 recurrence must be characterized using suitable recurrence relationship iii use of suitable attenuation 110 relationships to predict the distribution of ground motion intensities and iv the uncertainty in earthquake 111 location earthquake size and ground motion parameter prediction are combined to obtained the probability that 112 the ground motion parameter eg pga will be exceeded during a particular time period the primary output 113 from psha is the hazard curve showing the variation of selected groundmotion parameters such as peak 114 ground acceleration pga or spectral acceleration sa against the annual frequency of exceedance or its 115 reciprocal return period the design value is the groundmotion level that corresponds to a preselected design 116 return period bommer and abrahamson 2006 psha can reflect the actual hazard level due to bigger 117 5 earthquakes along with smaller events which are also crucial in the hazard estimation due to their higher 118 occurrence rates das et al 2006 psha is able to correctly reflect the actual knowledge of seismicity orozova 119 and suhadolc 1999 and calculates the rate at which different levels of ground motion are exceeded at the site by 120 considering the effects of all possible combinations of magnitudedistance scenarios in the probabilistic 121 approach effects of all the earthquakes expected to occur at various locations during a specified life period are 122 considered along with associated uncertainties and randomness of earthquake occurrences and attenuation of 123 seismic waves with distance also psha produces uniform hazard spectrum uhs which is a convenient tool 124 to compare the hazard representations of different sites trifunac 1990 todorovska et al 1995 peruzza et al 125 2000 and du and pan 2020 126 joshi and mohan 2011 developed the seismic hazard maps for the northeast himalaya using the 127 methodology suggested by joshi and patel 1997 anbazhagan et al 2015 estimated seismic hazard of patna 128 in bihar considering the regionspecific seismotectonic parameters maximum moment magnitude and ground 129 motion prediction equation kumar et al 2013a b documented seismic hazard studies in terms of peak ground 130 acceleration for the dehradun and lucknow cities which are situated in the himalayan foothills national 131 disaster management authority ndma 2010 developed the probabilistic seismic hazard map for various parts 132 of india most of the earlier published seismic hazard maps were developed for pga values based on old 133 attenuation relationships no such studies are currently available for the sitamarhi region in this paper seismic 134 hazard analysis of sitamarhi region has been attempted by psha using three different attenuations 135 relationships ie jain et al 2000 boore et al 2014 and bajaj and anbazhagan 2019 the gutenberg 136 richter recurrence law gutenberg and richter 1956 parameters a and b have been estimated using the 137 seismic data recorded within 500km radius of sitamarhi the major aim of this paper is to document a 138 comprehensive psha for the sitamarhi region this psha study incorporates not only pga but also 5 139 damped spectral accelerations sa at six periods 02 05 1 2 3 and 5s so that the uniform hazard spectrum 140 for sitamarhi can be generated based on the psha the bedrock pga values at sitamarhi with 2 and 10 141 exceedance probability in 50 years are 089 g and 061 g respectively 142 2 geology and seismotectonics of the study area 143 bihar is one of the seismically active regions in india due to the proximity of the region with seismically active 144 himalayan region india has been divided into four seismic zones ie zones ii iii iv and v and these zones 145 face higher risk of seismic activities with increasing zone numbers is 18932016 as per is 18932016 part 1 146 152 area of bihar state is in zone v 637 area is in zone iv and 211 area is in zone iii fig 1b 147 6 respectively the area considered in this study has a 500 km radius with the centre at sitamarhi latitudes 148 266n longitudes 8548e as per geographical perspective eurasian and indian tectonic plates colliding in 149 the north side of the sitamarhi which create high seismic activity in the region this collision formed the 150 tibetan plateau and the himalayan mountain range as the india plate is drifting towards northeast at 5 cmyear 151 2 inchesyear and the eurasian plate moves to the northward direction at a rate of 2 cmyear 08 inchesyear 152 therefore india is considered as the one of the fastest drifting continents in the world kolathayar et al 2012 153 this causes deformation in both plates and indian plate undergoing compression at a rate of 4 cmyear 16 154 inchesyear to perform the seismic hazard analysis seismic features like faults shear zones and lineaments 155 along with earthquakes mw  40 are the most important parameters north bihar region lies near the 156 seismically active himalayan belt and on the deep deposits of the indogangetic basin it is also surrounded by 157 various active faults dasgupta et al 1987 like main frontal thrust mft east patna fault epf west patna 158 fault wpf sitamarhi fault sif munger saharsa ridge fault msrf etc as shown in fig 2 and table 1 159 the east patna fault epf is most active among all these faults anbazghan et al 2015 the interaction 160 between east patna fault epf and himalayan frontal thrust hft has led to a number of earthquakes in the 161 past bhangar 1991 162 the sitamarhi has suffered numerous natural disasters including earthquakes the frequency of seismic 163 events related to the abovementioned faults is considerably high historic earthquakes such as biharnepal 164 earthquakes in 1934 and 1988 nepal earthquake in 2015 and also many other earthquakes have caused 165 significant economic losses as well as the loss of lives in the sitamarhi region in biharnepal earthquake of 166 1934 and 1988 large fissures were formed with many places suffered tilting and sinking of building 167 foundations the region was destroyed by the 1934 biharnepal earthquake due to extensive liquefaction the 168 whole of sitamarhi district was nearly destroyed not a single building was left unscathed large fissure of 732 169 m long 75 m wide and 1m deep filled with sand had formed at sitamarhi richter 1957 the most of the part 170 of sitamarhi district lies in seismic zone 5 with a zone factor of 036 is 18932016 the sites have soft 171 sediment and high groundwater level which creates an increased risk of liquefaction therefore the ground 172 motion parameters need to be estimated considering local geology lithological and hydrological consideration 173 verma et al 2014 174 3 earthquake catalogue and processing of earthquake data 175 previous earthquakes may provide some important information about the seismicity of the study area for 176 collecting the earthquake source data sitamarhi 2659 n 8550 e has been considered as the center of the 177 7 study area with a radius of 500 km a total of 62 linear seismotectonic sources and source to site distances as 178 shown in table 2 have been identified from the seismotectonic atlas of india gis 2000 the closest distance 179 rmin and longest distance rmax of different seismotectonic faults have been measure using arcgis arcmap 180 software burnwal et al 2017 burman et al 2020 several earthquake records are compiled from various 181 literatures and websites such as the united states geological survey usgs national center of seismology 182 strong motion virtual data center indian meteorological department imd and geological survey of india 183 the seismic events used in this study occurred between 1900 and november 2020 with a moment magnitude 184 mw varying between 4 and 83 a total of 1098 main shock events have been collected which consists of the 185 date time latitude and longitude of the epicentre focal depth and magnitude of earthquakes these collected 186 data were reported in different earthquake magnitude scale ie moment magnitude mw surfacewave 187 magnitude ms and body wave magnitude mb in order to maintain consistency it is essential to convert all 188 the different magnitudes to a single magnitude eg moment magnitude mw the numerous researchers 189 developed different empirical relationship for the conversion of magnitudes stromeyer et al 2004 castellaro et 190 al 2006 bormann et al 2007 thingbaijam et al 2008 scordilis 2006 storchak et al 2013 storchak et al 191 2013 proposed magnitude conversion relationships has been used to convert ms and mb to mw as mentioned 192 below 193 067 213 647 110 067 674 s s w s s m m m m m        1 194 138 179 w b m m   2 195 after converting all earthquake records in mw earthquake catalogue has been rearranged based on the moment 196 magnitude as shown in table 3 197 4 seismic hazard analysis 198 probabilistic seismic hazard analysis psha is the most commonly used approach to evaluate the seismic 199 hazard parameters for any engineering project psha is not only calculating for the worstcase ground motion 200 intensity it also considers all possible earthquake events and resulting ground motions cornell 1968 proposed 201 the probabilistic seismic hazard method to account for various uncertainties algermissen et al 1982 modified 202 psha method to consider the probability of occurrence of a particular magnitude and probability of 203 hypocentral distance and ground motion exceeding a specific value the major outcome from the psha is the 204 hazard curve which shows ground motion parameters such as pga or spectral acceleration sa as a function of 205 the mean annual rate of exceedance hazard curves for all sources are obtained by considering various 206 8 combinations of magnitudes hypocentral distances and the level of ground shaking the overall hazard curve 207 has been obtained after combining all individual hazard curves psha offers a framework for identifying 208 quantifying and rationally combining these uncertainties to provide a more comprehensive picture of the seismic 209 hazard the procedures followed in this present study are briefly described in the following subsections 210 41 identification and characterization of all earthquake sources 211 the first steps of this study involve the identification and characterization of all earthquake sources fault 212 rupture lineaments etc available in the study area a total of 62 seismic sources have been identified within the 213 500 km radial distance of sitamarhi all considered sources have experienced an earthquake magnitude of 4 or 214 greater than 4 in the past after identification all sources have been characterized for the distribution of 215 earthquake magnitudes all sources have a maximum potential magnitude mmax of the earthquake that cannot 216 be exceeded one third of the overall length of fault is generally taken as surface rupture length l of the fault 217 which producing the maximum earthquake mark 1977 the mmax has been determined as tabulated in table 218 2 for each earthquake sources using the following relationships between mmax and l wells and coppersmith 219 1994 220 10 max 516 162log mw l   for strike slip fault 3 221 10 max 500 122log mw l   for reverse fault 4 222 10 max 486 132log mw l   for normal fault 5 223 10 max 508 116log mw l   for all types of fault 6 224 42 seismicity parameter a and b 225 a recurrence relationship describes the average rate at which an earthquake of certain magnitude will be 226 exceeded a simple and most widely used relation for determining the seismicity of a source zone is gutenberg 227 richter recurrence law it is assumed as exponential distribution of magnitude and is generally expressed as 228 log  n m a bm   7 229 here nm is the number of earthquakes greater than or equal to m the parameter a describes the 230 seismic activity and b describes a relative abundance of large to smaller shock whose value is close to 1 231 anbazhagan et al 2009 a lower value of b denoted the occurrence of larger percentage of higher magnitude 232 earthquakes and higher b value means larger percentage of lower magnitude earthquake occurrence out of the 233 total number of earthquakes another seismic parameter a value represented general earthquake activity in the 234 study area during the study period the value of a describes the no of earthquakes per year these seismicity 235 9 parameters of a and b values are region specific the range of b value is 06  b  15 for various parts in india 236 ndma 2010 the earthquakes of magnitude 40 or greater than 40 have been considered in the calculation of 237 seismicity for the sitamarhi region the histogram in fig 3 shows the summary of earthquake events in the last 238 twelve decades which has been used in the present study from this data seismicity parameter of a and b values 239 are calculated from magnitude vs logarithmic function of a cumulative number of events per year fig 4 a 240 comparison of estimated a and b values of the present study with the nearby areas are shown in table 4 the g 241 r relationship for the sitamarhi region is expressed as 242 log   436 085 n m m   8 243 43 sourcetosite distance and magnitude probability distribution 244 the spatial uncertainty in sourcetosite distance can be described by the probability density function pdf 245 source to site distance has been characterized by comparatively coarse histogram to restrict the number of 246 computations engaged in the accessible instance the difference between shortest and longest possible distance 247 has been divided into ten divisions the approximation to the sourcetosite probability distribution for west 248 patna fault wpfss1 and sitamarhi faults sif first segment are 03053 and 0354 respectively by 249 dividing each source zone into a large 1000 in this study number of segments of equal length the distribution 250 of sourcetosite distance has been characterized the normalized histogram of sourcetosite distance for wpf 251 ss1 and sif are shown in figs 5a and b 252 the bounded or doubly truncated gutenbergrichter recurrence law between the magnitude m0 and 253 mmax is used to compute the probability density function pdf of m the minimum magnitude m0 is 254 considered as 4 in this study and mmax are different for different faults as mentioned above in subsection 51 255 for each source zone the bounded probability distribution of magnitude with a lower bound m0 and an upper 256 bound mmax can be expressed in terms of cumulative

the normalized histogram of approximation to the magnitude probability distribution for the wpfss1 and sif 260 in the study area are shown in figs 6a and b 261 44 ground motion prediction equation gmpe 262 10 regionspecific ground motion prediction equation gmpe played a crucial role in the macrozonation and 263 microzonation of any location the gmpes are usually obtained empirically by least square regression for a 264 particular site using the sitespecific strong motion data however some amount of randomness in the data is 265 inevitable due to uncertainty in the mechanics of rupture variability of sources travel path and site conditions 266 however very limited regionspecific gmpes are available for various parts of the india and the world for 267 using it in seismic hazard assessment ndma 2010 at the same time various researches working with next 268 generation attenuation nga models for better prediction of ground shaking and designing the earthquake 269 resistant structure atkinson and boore 2006 campbell and bozorgnia 2008 wooddell and abrahamson 2012 270 boore et al 2014 the proper selection of gmpe is one of the crucial steps in a seismic hazard analysis for 271 the present work three gmpes jain et al 2000 boore et al 2014 bajaj and anbazhagan 2019 have been 272 selected jain et al 2000 proposed the attenuation relationship for the central himalayan region based on 273 strong motion accelerographs sma and structural response recorder ssr to calculate pga the functional 274 form of this gmpe is as follows 275 1 2 3 4 ln  ln  pga b b m b r b r     11 276 where pga is the peak ground acceleration in g for central himalayan earthquakes coefficient b1 4135 b2 277 0647 b3 000142 b4 0753 and standard deviation   059 there are several gmpes developed for 278 similar tectonic conditions which can be also used for himalayan region anbazhagan et al 2015 one such 279 gmpe is the one proposed by boore et al 2014 the functional form of the gmpe proposed by boore et al 280 2014 is as follows 281 30 30 ln               e p jb s s jb n jb s y f m mech f r m f v r m m r v       12 282 here lny is the natural logarithm of a vertical ground motion intensity measure eg pga sa in g f f and 283 f represent perioddependent functions for the source e for event path p and site s effects respectively 284  is the fractional number of the standard deviations of a single predicted value of lny away from the mean 285 and  is the total standard deviation of the model the m mech rand v are the predictor variables and 286 the parameter mech  0 1 2 and 3 for unspecified sf nf and rf respectively bajaj and anbazhagan 2018 287 reported the suitability of various functional forms for the distance and magnitude scaling using the mixedeffect 288 regression of residual calculated from the functional form given by ngawest 2 project based on that bajaj 289 and anbazhagan 2019 proposed the gmpe for the himalayan region as 290 2 1 2 3 4 7 ln   6 9  ln ln  6 m y a a m a m a r a r m a r            13 291 11 where lny m r and  are the logarithm of ground motion magnitude hypocentral distance and standard 292 deviation a a a a a a are the corresponding regressions coefficient the coefficient a is equal to a 293 when m 60 and r  300 else equal to a the comparison between the above three gmpes has been shown 294 for a moment magnitude of 65 in fig7 the pga values according to bajaj and anbazhagan 2019 are the 295 maximum compared to other two gmpes the pga values calculated according to boore et al 2014 are in 296 the middle of that calculated from jain et al 2000 and bajaj and anbazhagan 2019 gmpe 297 45 temporal uncertainty 298 usually the sources will produce earthquake of different sizes up to the maximum earthquake with smaller 299 earthquakes occurring more frequently than larger ones the temporal uncertainty or the occurrence of 300 earthquakes in a seismic source is described by the poissons model the probability distribution is defined in 301 terms of the annual rate of exceeding the ground motion level z at the site under consideration vz due to all 302 possible pairs of the magnitude m and epicentral distance r of the earthquake event expected around the site 303 considering its random nature anbazhagan et al 2009 the probability of ground motion parameter at a given 304 site z will exceed a specified level z during a specified time t is expressed as follows 305     1   v z t p z z e v z t     14 306 where vz is mean annual rate of exceedance the average frequency during the time period t at which the 307 level of ground motion parameters z exceed level z at a given site the function vz incorporates the 308 uncertainty in time size and location of future earthquakes and uncertainty in the level of ground motion they 309 produce at the site the functional form of vz is as follows 310                   15 311 where nm is the earthquake frequency of seismic source n above a minimum magnitude mo fm is the 312 probability density function for the minimum magnitude mo and maximum magnitude mu frm is the 313 conditional probability density function for the distance to earthquake rupture and pz  zm r is the 314 probability that given a magnitude m earthquake at a distance r from the site the ground motion exceeds 315 level z 316 5 result and discussion 317 the hazard curve expresses the frequency of exceedance of various levels of ground motions as a function of 318 ground motion parameter the calculation of all the probabilities in terms of hazard curve defines the annual 319 rate of exceedance versus corresponding ground motion hazard curves has been plotted for all the sources and 320 12 also the total hazard curve has been calculated based on all three gmpes the hazard curves plotted using the 321 gmpe suggested by boore et al 2014 for all sources are shown in fig 8 it has been seen from the fig 8 that 322 wpfss1 is the most hazardous fault located at a hypocentral distance of 2111 km with s fault length of 6304 323 km and a maximum magnitude mw max of 66 similarly sif and wpfss2 are also significantly hazardous 324 faults for the sitamarhi region the total hazard curve for the study area has been generated by the summation of 325 all the hazard curves obtained from all the sources the three total hazard curves plotted using three different 326 gmpes are shown in fig 9 at pga value 01 g the mean annual rate of exceedance is obtained as 034 using 327 jain et al 2000 095 using boore et al 2014 and 092 using bajaj and anbazhagan 2019 gmpes 328 respectively corresponding return periods reciprocal of the mean annual rate of exceedance are 294 years 329 105 years and 109 years accordingly in fig 9 the value obtained using boore et al 2014 suggested gmpe 330 are in between the values obtained using other two gmpes therefore total hazard curves at different periods 331 for spectral acceleration sa values have been calculated using boore et al 2014 gmpe it can be inferred 332 from the fig 9 using boore et al 2014 gmpe that the mean annual rate of exceedance for 036 g at zero 333 second period pga is 0029 which will give the return period 3448 years this indicates that pga of 061 g 334 has a 10  probability of exceedance in 50 years at the sitamarhi region the cumulative hazard curves 335 obtained for the sitamarhi region for 5  damped peak spectral acceleration at 02 s 05 s 1 s 2 s 3 s and 5 s 336 period are shown in fig 10 similar comparison as mentioned above indicates that the 5  damped spectral 337 acceleration of 036 g has a mean annual rate of exceedance of 0259 for 02 s period 0033 for 05 s 0003 for 1 338 s 000004 for 2 s periods respectively from these results it can be inferred that as the period of intesest 339 changes the corresponding return period also has been changed drastically initially the return period decreases 340 from 1 year for pga to 4 years for 02 s and again increase to 303 years for 05 s 29411 years for 1 s and 341 2583979 years for 2 s respectively 342 another major endproduct of a psha is the uniform hazard specta uhs the uhs are a spectral curve 343 which shows the variation of spectral acceleration sa at different period for a same probability of exceedance 344 in the present study uhs for sitamarhi for 2  and 10  probabilities of exceedance in the 50 years have been 345 shown in fig 11 the spectral acceleration at zero second period is called zero spectral acceleration sa or 346 pga for sitamarhi the pga values of sitamarhi region considering 2  and 10  probabilities of exceedance 347 in the 50 years are 089 g and 061 g previously burnwal et al 2016 documented the maximum pga value 348 for sitamarhi region in their dsha research as 0262 g a total of 62 faults has been identified and 349 characterized in the region and their cumulative effects have been considered in this study two new gmpes 350 13 applicable for himalayan region have also been used in this study the calculated pga value from the present 351 study is comparable and slightly higher than other published values which may be attributed due to the 352 consideration of updated seismicity and gmpes in this study 353 6 conclusion 354 the article presents a seismic hazard analysis and sitespecific design spectrum development for the sitamarhi 355 region considering probabilistic approaches along with regionspecific data based on the study the following 356 observation have been drawn from this study 357  the seismic parameter has been evaluated using the seismic data collected over a radius of 500 km and 358 62 seismotectonic linear sources have been identified and characterised the maximum earthquake 359 magnitude was estimated by wells and coppersmith 1994 equation for all faults and the overall 360 maximum magnitude has been found as 8 for mct 361  the seismicity parameter of a and b were estimated from the gutenbergrichter gr relationship 362 considering historic moment magnitude data as 436 and 085 respectively these values are in 363 agreement with the earlier reported results from the nearby regions 364  hazard curves are generated using three regions specific gmpes boore et al 2014 jain et al 2000 365 and bajaj and anbazhagan 2019 a mean total hazard curve black curve with star marker in fig 9 366 has been presented considering equal weightage assigned to all three gmpes used in the study 367 different period hazard curves fig 10 also developed for the period of 02 s 05 s 1 s 2 s 3 s and 5 s 368 using the gmpe proposed by boore et al 2014 369  uniform hazard spectrum fig 11 for the 2  and 10  probability of exceedance in 50 years has 370 been presented for the region which is situated at zone v as per the indian seismic zonation map 371  the present result is more regionspecific and advanced than the previous studies and can be used 372 further for microzonation work of sitamarhi district the seismic hazard values given in this paper are 373 based on a vs30 value of 1500 ms these presented curves in this study may alter when sitespecific 374 soil properties will be considered 375 376 declaration 377 acknowledgements 378 the

social inclusion which effects their financial inclusion thus inclusion determines not only a humans access to facilities as supporting a inclusive economy implies but also their perspectives and attitudes toward that access and also their anticipation for the returns via optimist or pessimistic on social capital investments thus there are two ways to conceptualize inclusion first of all inclusivity affects how one thinks and perceives about the outcomes of investing and forming social connections second by influencing a persons decisions about institutional access inclusion affects her decisionmaking capabilities and resources eg financial educational etc 61 414 digital inclusion the term digital inclusion can be summed up as required activities to ensure that all individuals and societies especially the most unprivileged have direct exposure to and use communication and information technologies 70 this includes the availability of virtual skills training tech support and access to electronic skills training as well as software apps and components meant to support and inspire selfsufficiency the willingness to participate and collaboration 70 it also includes access to sufficient internet connectivity and to the digital devices that users need millions of people have stayed at home to work learn and live remotely thanks to the rapid spread of the respiratory virus covid19 which at the time this article was published brought digital inclusion to the forefront as a key element of social inclusion the requirement for quarantine has resulted into resurgence of conversations about the nowclear digital injustices 71 there are various articles which ponder on the concept of digital inclusion which is discussed below 1 parsons c  hick s f 2008 72 numerous observers have supported technology access programs but the key question is whether they are moving in the right direction this study investigated various ictrelated aspects in relation to the concept of social inclusion we argue that digital inclusion rather than digital divide is a more accurate description of the reality of ict gaps we come to the conclusion that because current policies and programs are framed within the constrained context of access and use behavior where business and ecommerce interests take precedence over those of citizens rights and social inclusion they do not address the larger issues associated with the digital divide 2 tay et al 2022 73 even though it is predicted that more people will use digital financial products the epidemic has caused problems for many countries a thorough review of the literature looks into the inclusion of global financial technology as a result according to this report emerging countries especially those in asia welcome and promote digital financial inclusion to help fight poverty the data demonstrate however that there is a persistent gap in access to and use of digital financial services in developing nations among

address the societal structures of financial participation with new technologies moving beyond a basic individualism acquirer binary structure and supply oriented financial infrastructure is required due to a lack of social awareness basic interconnection and financial literacy digital services have helped make financial services more accessible to people in more places but these services are not being fully utilized the term digital inclusion refers to policies put in place to narrow the digital divide and encourage digital literacy whereas the term digital divide refers to the divide between those with and without internet access while digital literacy focuses on the talents and skills required once access is accessible the digital divide refers to the disparity between those who have and do not have internet access 75 as demand for digital gadgets and reliable internet grows it is becoming increasingly evident that being socially ostracized also implies being technologically excluded social inclusion on the other hand doesnt always emerge from digital inclusion internet users ability to use their access varies depending on their financial situation offline resources the types of devices they can access and maintain and whether people rely on mobile networks or ease of access through an internet provider 76 and other factors such as digital skills 7778 hence this literature

decrease which is consistent with people not disclosing decisions that resulted in poor outcomes market returns media attention regional stocks missing regional factors short sales prohibitions or

action it suggests that a persons conduct which in turn defines his attitude toward an activity is determined by two beliefs perceived utility noted pu and perceived ease of use these beliefs in turn

or a social units network of interactions is how social capital is defined operational human capital interpersonal social capital and intellectual social capital are the three primary aspects systemic

resources nahapiet  ghoshal 1998 berraies et al 2020 121 122 7 social network theory according to social network theory there are two types of links weaker ties which are links with strangers whom one only contacts on occasion and strong ties that are ties with close relatives and friends while weak ties aid in the transmission of unique knowledge across otherwise isolated social network segments strong attachments to coherent connections can result in a lack of fresh data retrieval and cognitive lockin according to this theory information obtained through close connections is duplicated and of poor value and the usefulness of social connections is determined by how well the resources a person can access through their contacts match the information she needs learning from ones personal contacts will therefore probably have little effect on ones stock market participation granovetter m 1983 granovetter m 2005 123124 international journal of case studies in business it and education

capital investment yields participation in stocks over the lifecycle compatible with the data in contrast to returns on stocks returns on human capital are determined by both individual

improvements required  current studies have shown low participation of individual and households but due to social inclusion and financial literacy the level of participation has shown upward trend in participation but at the same time present studies have addressed mere traditional social interaction and financial literacy which are insufficient to inspire individuals to participate in the stock market recent researchers have found digital gap which leads to inequality of wealth distribution due to low stock market participation as an optimal solution to the current status and issues concerning stock market participation researcher recommends digital inclusion of an individual as a major catalyst to improve the involvement of all the section of the society along with their financial literacy and social inclusion to promote balanced growth and economic development of a country 7 research gap  researcher has identified 3 major issues related to stock market participation ie financial illiteracy social exclusion and digital gap leading to low stock market participation these problems have already been addressed to some or the other population where digital gap has been recently found numerous studies have found that financial knowledge and social inclusion significantly influence stock market participation and also how digitalization influences involvement of households in financial market based on the present studies following research gaps have been found  many studies have shown financial literacy and social inclusion as a major catalyst in influencing stock market participation hence the researcher has further opportunity to find how financial literacy and socialization will improve stock market participation when it is mediated through digital inclusion  secondly majority of the studies have addressed this issue by taking households as their population therefore researcher can address this issue by considering the individual investors  lastly many studies have conducted research at international national and general context so the researcher has a scope to conduct further study at local context 8 research agendas based on research gap  as researcher considers digital inclusion social inclusion and financial literacy as an optimal solution for the problem of stock market participation following research agendas have been formulated  does financial literacy improve stock market participation  whether social inclusion is important to determine stock market participation  how literacy level on financial aspects and social inclusiveness will improve stock market participation when it is mediated through digital inclusion  will the above hypothetical relationship proves true for an individual investor  do financial literacy social inclusion and digital inclusion influence stock market participation of individual investors in the region of dakshina kannada 9 analysis of research agenda  present research agenda is pertinent in its own context as it will address the major issues such as  wealth inequality this issue has been addressed in decades of studies and still exists in india one of the contributing factors to reduce it can be encouraging individuals participation in the stock market  financial illiteracy in spite of increase in the literacy level literacy on financial aspects has not improved which is essential to accumulate wealth and take effective financial decisions  digital exclusion after pandemic digitalization has taken up drastic adoption by various sections of the society still there exists a digital gap which acts as a barrier in the involvement of stock market participation hence considering this issue is very crucial  social exclusion social exclusion leads to asymmetric information which again poses a problem in the involvement of an individual in financial market participation addressing the above issue through present research the researcher intended to contribute new knowledge for wealth distribution financial literacy social inclusion digital inclusion economic empowerment and overall development of a country international journal of case

consumer desires and needs it is vital to understand client behaviour and purchasing patterns in order to satisfy them the three areas of consumer behaviour that require careful consideration are situational influences sociocultural influences and psychological influences the fact that baby care goods must be applied directly to the skin body and other portions of newborns or infants presents

frequently seem to care more about how a product looks feels and is perceived by others than if it is eventually secure and worth the amount they are spending 26 7 customers expectation on baby care products  in todays market all corporate activities are more focused on delighting the client by attending to their needs through efficient service because baby products are expensive businesses are constantly searching for the most innovative solutions in order to ensure their childs safety and security mothers are constantly concerned with finding the greatest products and taking the necessary safety measures how parents separate the best products from those that are only claiming to be the best however is the problem parents refer to prices of related goods and websites where consumers may select and review sites journals and recommendations from others because most firsttime mothers are frequently uninformed of the differences between the things parents take these precautions in

advertisements depicting how newborns become brilliant after ingesting particular types of baby milk formula 30however the infant grows quickly throughout these first two years and gradually gains independence as it masters muscle control consumers of infant formula are constantly exposed to advertisements depicting how newborns become brilliant after ingesting particular types of baby milk formula 31 indian mothers are observed to be more concerned about their childrens health and safety as soon as they notice that something is hurting their child they instantly take a step back when parents learn about the harmful components and chemicals included in some products they instantly stop purchasing them as was the case in the newborn care industry and for that reason parents begin choosing natural and organic products to protect their children 32 the products brand price convenience advertising and promotional impacts the babys reaction to the product the opinions of friends

pakkala et al 2022 wwwsrinivaspublicationcom page 466 11 suggestions  the following suggestions are made for improving the customers satisfaction towards consumer baby care products 1 first and foremost consumers decisions are heavily influenced by quality and price which are still considered to be the most delicate factors therefore the makers must concentrate their efforts on defending these parameters 2 product makers must invest their time and energy in product development issues due to the increased rates of various diseases obesity and allergies in children there are high expectations for the quality of baby food including baby breakfast cereals fruit bags vegetable containers baby snacks beverages and many more 3 since oils in the skin surface of the child are crucial cleansers should have extremely gentle qualities to prevent excessive oil loss 4 to be able to concentrate on efficient marketing tactics for their products baby care product firms need to know their target audience and competition very well 5 to maximize the effectiveness of their marketing tactics and be successful in the baby product industry businesses must also pay attention to their products distribution pricing and the manner they are communicated to parents 6 manufacturers of baby care products can survey consumers to learn what they need 12 conclusons  the market for baby care products is expanding and changing over time in india as a result of changes in consumer behaviour rising incomes and a growth in the proportion of working women when purchasing baby care items there is a favorable correlation between family income number of children and educational attainment parents are becoming more aware as they get more educated and employed companies are now concentrating on more inventive concepts prior to the release of a new product they are also concentrating on changes in consumer taste demands and preferences todays market is mostly focused on the customer the customer is king of the market nowadays customers are given careful consideration in contemporary marketing different types of items are created by product manufacturers in order to be sold through marketing but marketing the product is not a simple task today it can be difficult to sell a product without doing market survey and without knowing what the market wants and needs its critical to recognize and

paths of business driven by consumers empowered by social media understanding the role that each feature drawn from online platforms has on price fluctuation is vital for leveraging decision making in this study 5603 simulations of online reservations from 23 portuguese cities were gathered including characterizing features from social media web visibility and hotel amenities from four renowned online sources bookingcom tripadvisor google and facebook after data preparation including removal of irrelevant features in terms of modeling and outlier cleaning a tuned dataset of 3137 simulations and 30 features including the price charged per day was used first for evaluating the modeling performance of an ensemble of multilayer perceptrons and then for extracting valuable knowledge through the databased sensitivity analysis findings show that all features from the encompassed factors social media online reservation hotel characteristics web visibility and city play a significant role in price keywords online booking pricing hotel reservation social media data mining 2 1 introduction pricing is at the core of any marketing strategy including in the hospitality industry leveraging new paradigms of revenue management to incorporate technological evolution mcguire 2016 in the most recent decades a plethora of new technologies have emerged to change the landscape of hotel accommodation booking the advent of the internet which has been revolutionizing businesses worldwide since the 1990s virtually enabled every organization regardless of its size to keep a cyberpresence boosting its brand image to a planetary scale doherty  ellis chadwick 2010 websites have evolved from static to dynamic usergenerated contents as a result of the web 20 revolution by empowering consumers to an unforeseen level virtually every user is a content producer and may provide feedback on any product or service thus influencing others through electronic wordofmouth ewom labrecque et al 2013 corporations worldwide need to keep pace of their websites performance measured by the rank position in queries performed on search engines especially in google which dominates the landscape across the globe paraskevas et al 2011 google ads is a tool commercialized by google to help companies gain some control on the position its webpage ranks lee 2011 additionally secured online payment systems enable hotel website visitors to finish the transaction and book rooms at the distance of a click li et al 2015 furthermore global scale pure digital players have emerged to dominate markets by offering digital services which facilitate customer acquisition of thirdparty products or services such as hotel rooms booking alt  zimmermann 2015 particularly relevant in the hospitality industry are especially designed customer feedback sites such as tripadvisor where users may score hotel units andor analyze other tourists opinions ayeh et al 2016 such profusion of information can be effectively used by managers to support their pricing strategies 3 social media and online travel agencies otas have brought price transparency to an unforeseen level from a consumer perspective mcguire 2016 today a tourist will likely access to an online customer reviews platform to assess others opinions before making the purchase probably complementing the information by going to the hotels website to obtain additional information on the amenities provided and detailed photos then the user can access an ota and compare the prices practiced by the different alternatives previously identified before finally booking a room this motivational example highlights the need for hoteliers to account for all the information that may influence tourists decisions when defining prices xu et al 2017 two recent studies were also devoted to analyzing prices on a wide scale oses et al 2016a oses et al 2016b the first gathered data from digital footprint from the balearic islands while the second used a data scraping bot to collect prices from bookingcom from the basque country nevertheless neither considered hotels scores on social media nor hotels amenities the present study aims at filling such research gap by unveiling the factors contributing to price definition through an advanced data mining model 2 literature review 21online booking and social media the development of new internetbased information systems has driven the task of booking rooms in hotels toward online booking whether using hotels websites or through global otas with the latter prevailing as the dominant source of online booking tse 2013 park et al 2017 moreover the hospitality industry was among the first sectors to embrace online customer feedback through specifically designed review sites such as tripadvisor tourists are able to report their experiences in both quantitative scores and textual comments influencing 4 prospective users jeacle  carter 2011 generic social networks can also be powerful ewom tools within the hospitality industry with literature acknowledging such relevance nunkoo et al 2013 specifically hotel managers are aware of the importance of facebook and most hotels currently have an official facebook page where users can write comments or like publications leung et al 2015 additionally hotels can also be rated and tourists who stayed in the hotel can mark their photos as having been there increasing the count of the number of stays at the hotel nevertheless no study was found using such specific information each of the numerous available sources of information can play a role in the consumer purchasing decision moon  kamakura 2016 murphy and chen 2016 evaluated online sources used in hotel bookings and concluded that all online communication channels should be accounted for within a consistent marketing communication strategy including search engines for a first assessment of hotel offers and otas and review sites on a second information level understanding the distinct influencing dimensions on users behavior is a key asset for supporting managerial decisions in the current big data world as such hoteliers need to cope with all available variables including those they cannot control in order to incorporate indepth knowledge in their emarketing strategies to thrive and excel in a smaller and interconnected world 22hotel booking and pricing revenue management emerged in the hospitality industry to leverage decision making on the most profitable mix of variables influencing revenue including the number of rooms sold and the price paid for each room however new communication media including both otas and 5 online reviews platforms pose big challenges in a social world noone et al 2017 managers need to conceive adequate pricing strategies in a difficult context facing price transparency as users now can simulate bookings at the distance of a click and easily compare the prices offered for similar services mcguire 2016 recently kimes 2017 identified the following major drivers for change in revenue management information technology data analytics followed by mobile technology and economic conditions moreover yacouel and fleischer 2012 found that hotels which received higher scores on otas charge higher prices showing an effect of price based on customer rating ling et al 2014 studied an optimal online pricing strategy for a hotel being promoted in an ota through sensitivity analysis these authors unveiled a higher likelihood of larger profits for hotel units with a lower occupancy rate prior to establishing a promotion agreement with an ota however their study considered only both hotel and ota characteristics not accounting for other dimensions such as consumer behavior eg the days ahead of reservation or the length of stay or the social media effect according to anderson 2012 social media holds the potential to move markets by driving consumers purchasing intentions thus influencing lodging performance in fact online feedback on social media platforms is a driving force that hotel managers cannot afford to neglect calheiros et al 2017 23data and text mining on hotel booking website several techniques are available for modeling price such as the traditional linear regression and decision trees along with the most sophisticated neural networks and support vector machines cortez 2010 while data mining models can provide predictive knowledge by directly 6 applying the model to new input data for prediction of an outcome these models can also be used to obtain explanatory knowledge by understanding how the model was conceived when it acquired knowledge from the data used for training it a few methods can be used such as rules extraction and sensitivity analysis while the former might fail at assessing the representativeness of the model due to disregard of relevant rules and danger of generalization mainly resultant of discretization of the complex nonlinear relations hidden within the model the latter constitutes an interesting approach by its noninvasive nature as it is based on varying the input features through their range of possible values to assess how sensitive such changes are on the outcome cortez  embrechts 2013 moreover in the present study the databased sensitivity analysis dsa is adopted as it considers variations of multiple features at the same time allowing to disentangle interrelated features although such method is recent it was introduced in 2013 it has already been successfully applied to a wide range of problems such as in bank telemarketing moro et al 2015 and social media moro et al 2016 as well as for modeling tripadvisors score of hotels moro et al 2017 recent research suggests that data mining is an increasingly relevant trend in tourism and hospitality especially in the current big data age with manifold sources schuckert et al 2015 nevertheless it should be stressed that a large portion of research on tourism using data mining is still devoted to forecasting tourism demand one of the most prolific and interesting domains from a managerial perspective moro  rita 2016 radojevic et al 2015 included as inputs to their linear mixed model features on hotel amenities the hotel number of stars location and the price effect as measured by the average city accommodation price and the specific hotel price the same authors modeled customer experience hotel score given by tourists and found that the most influencing features on the score were the hotel star rating system and the prices a recent 7 hot topic consists in extracting knowledge from unstructured textual contents gathered from social media such as the comments contained in online reviews calheiros et al 2017 text mining enables to find hidden patterns within text helping to achieve a deeper understanding of customer feedback through the analysis of a large number of reviews such knowledge may be presented in coherent topics aggregating meaningful reviews classified by relevant words guo et al 2017 or through the identification of determinant factors characterized by highloading terms xu  li 2016 3 methods 31data collection and preparation the geographic location of hotel units is a known key influencing factor of tourism demand and thus of the prices charged for accommodation radojevic et al 2015 it is usually associated with the brand image and awareness of each specific tourist location sahin  baloglu 2014 therefore this study focuses on portugal an attractive tourist country with tourism accounting as one of the major economic sectors although being a small country in europe it holds regional asymmetries and a high seasonality degree with a summer peak as a result of its attractive shore line with renowned beaches andraz et al 2015 the tourist destinations included the eighteen continental district capitals plus five renowned tourist cities data is the key raw ingredient for successful data mining experiments considering the present research is an attempt to incorporate as many factors as possible that may have an impact on hotel price several sources were in demand for collecting the required data in order to maximize the impact each information source has on users the chosen online sources were the top ranked 8 brands for each type of information as a main source for all online booking simulations bookingcom was used as it is considered one of the mainstreams in ota yacouel  fleischer 2012 although bookingcom also implements a scoring system for tourists to rate hotel units the recent research note by mellinas et al 2015 uncovered an important limitation its rating system ranges from 25 to 10 although several previous studies using data from bookingcom seem to account for a more standard 0 to 10 scale subsequent study by the same authors concludes its rating system significantly distorts scores particularly in hotels with low and medium scores mellinas et al 2016 given such evidence the present study does not include scores granted on bookingcom instead it adopts the most renowned tourism and hospitality scoring platform tripadvisor jeacle  carter 2011 and the social network that spreads across the globe facebook reaching 201 billion monthly active users as of june 30 2017 facebook 2017 furthermore recent literature has shown consistency between bookingcom and tripadvisor eg marchiori et al 2011 bltescu 2015 nevertheless a comparison was made between the scores granted on bookingcom and on tripadvisor table 1 shows consistency between the two platforms for the hotels considered in the dataset as tourists are becoming increasingly aware of online reviews it seems to contribute to standardizing hotels scores in online platforms yet it is a subject where more research is in demand to fully assess such level of standardization the fourth source included is google the search engines conspicuous market leader miklok  dao 2016 figure 1 shows how each of the four global online data sources was used in the procedure to gather all data and provides a few examples of the collected features which is explained shortly the procedure for collecting the data consisted in creating a set of online booking scenarios for each of the twenty three cities considering the following guidelines attempting to book a room 9 through bookingcom on a few hotel units varying the number of adults one or two considering most hotels do not allow more than two adults in the same room the number of children to a maximum of two considering also most hotels do not allow more than two in the same room with adults and setting the age to the constant of 4 years the number of days ahead of reservation considering short medium and long term schedules during 2016 and 2017 and the duration of the stay to accomplish such task twentythree volunteers were assigned a city each and asked to perform bookings considering real scenarios that would make sense in their case for different real situations including business and leisure travels after reaching the purchase page but without finishing it all required reservation data was collected thus ensuring real online information would be used for the empirical research at least two hundred simulations were collected for each city to assure a reasonable number of different cases the experiments were conducted in the first quarter of 2016 with all reservations encompassed within the years of 2016 and 2017 from february2016 to august2017 the hotel characteristics eg number of stars were gathered from bookingcom while also performing a search on google and collecting additional data if the hotel had a website while a vast number of amenities are available this study focused specifically on those which are different among the studied hotels therefore we considered free wifi as radojevic et al 2015 also did but did not included the other two used by the aforementioned authors air conditioning and lobby bar since all the units in the dataset offered them additionally eight other amenities were included that presented a differentiating factor among the studied units while many more could be included it is very difficult to identify all possible features that may affect customer satisfaction given the vast array available 10 both tripadvisor and facebook were accessed to gather customer scores on the hotels table 2 shows all the features collected the selected hotels were the ones shown on the first page results from the query on bookingcom for each city while the simulations consisted in varying the period of stay and the number of people features marked with sourceuser the price considered for this study was the lowest result among the different types of rooms available for the designated number of people and period considering bookingcom suggests a few possibilities when available google was used for two types of search first by querying with the quoted hotel name then by querying with hotels plus the city name for assessing the range of hits as a result of the brand image associated with the city name which may influence hotel prices sahin  baloglu 2014 for hotels with their own websites two types of information were gathered if the website allowed online reservation and if it provided an online payment system for the case of google ads besides finding if the hotel appeared in any advertisement the link to which the ad redirected the browser was also accounted for as shown in table 2 from facebook a few different metrics were collected some hotels have official facebook pages while other pages are marked as unofficial also besides the usual number of likes if a user stays in a hotel and publishes a photo marking it as being taken in the hotel the number of stays increases facebook also provides a scoring system from 1 to 5 similar to tripadvisor which was also taken into account along with the number of reviews with a higher number strengthening the hotel score helping to build its reputation as shown by yacouel and fleischer 2012 a total of 5603 simulations were made and gathered through the procedure described and illustrated in figure 1 however 2466 were discarded almost 426 due to four main reasons identified in table 3 hence a total of 3137 remained to be used for building the pricing model 11 the data preparation procedure resulted in eleven original features being removed table 4 outliers for numerical data were identified using boxplots eg figure 2 and extremely unbalanced binary features were also discarded according to formans 2003 recommendation also new features were computed as described in table 5 for example a new feature accounting for the nonworking days encompassed in the period of stay was computed to address the different prices practiced by hoteliers depending on the days sainaghi 2010 the resulting dataset included a total of 30 features listed in table 6 including the price per day the outcome feature to be modeled and 3137 simulations 32data mining and knowledge extraction the result of the data collection and preparation procedures was a tuned dataset ready to feed a data mining algorithm to build the pricing model based on the remaining 29 features identified in table 6 for modeling price the technique adopted was an ensemble of multilayer perceptrons which has provided the most accurate models in several previous studies when compared to other advanced modeling techniques such as support vector machines moro et al 2014 neural networks are a computerized attempt to mimic the human brain with neurons interconnected to determine a certain outcome based on patterns previously detected on input features which were used to train the network russell  norvig 2002 the multilayer perceptron is the most popular neural network architecture with hidden layers in most cases one is enough composed of several hidden nodes neurons and one final output node haykin 2009 figure 3 exhibits the structure of a simple network with one hidden layer composed of m neurons and n input features where each neuron is activated through an activation function     12 as a mean to assure modeling robustness the followed procedure comprised two stages a model evaluation stage and a knowledge extraction stage both are illustrated in figure 4 during model evaluation the dataset was split into deciles and a kfold crossvalidation computation was executed with 910 of the simulations used for training the model and the remaining 110 for testing its performance in unforeseen data allowing to assess prediction accuracy berry et al 2004 to further validate the procedure a total of n20 runs were executed and the average predictions were computed to address the fact that artificial neural networks are complex non linear models thus each execution may provide different results in this stage both mean absolute error mae and mean absolute percentage error mape were computed and evaluated to assure reasonable performance prediction metrics before stepping into the next stage knowledge extraction was accomplished by first building a model upon all the data thus reflecting the hidden patterns of knowledge from all the gathered simulations thereafter the most relevant features were analyzed indepth through dsa for acquiring its effects on price translating it into actionable knowledge to leverage hospitality business all the experiments described were programmed into the r statistical platform a freeware and open source tool with a worldwide community of enthusiasts which provide a myriad of packages for numerous purposes among those is the rminer which implements a simple set of coherent functions for data mining including the dsa cortez 2010 4 results and discussion the result of both the modeling evaluation and knowledge extraction model is displayed in table 7 for both metrics in the realistic predictive scenario of the modeling evaluation stage mae 13 reveals an average discrepancy of 1432  to the real prices with mape showing a relative deviation of 1270 these metrics express good predictions considering a multilayer perceptron model achieves an approximation of around 87 when modeling price hence this first stage procedure validates the dataset and modeling technique for knowledge extraction all data is used to build the model and the same data is then used to compute the difference of the model outcomes to the real prices thus testing the fitting of the actual data for this reason mae and mape are obviously better achieving slightly lower error metrics with a mape of around 106 the model is then opened using dsa to extract knowledge on how it makes its decisions dsa provided a rank of the booking simulation features that were used for modeling price table 8 shows the results in descending order of its relevance the first interesting result to note is the fact that while some features have a significantly higher relevance there is not a single feature or group of features that clearly standout implying that each individual feature plays a role on price definition to summarize the findings and provide a visual picture each feature was categorized under one of five influencing groups social media reservation hotel city and web visibility figure 5 unveils social media hotel and reservation features as the three most influencing groups the results for portugal are consistent with the current state of the art as social media are increasingly relevant in pricing noone et al 2011 to add up to known influence of both hotel dev et al 2017 and reservation guo et al 2013 features thus the presented results emphasize the intrinsic bidirectional relationship between managers which are concerned with their hotels brand image on social media and possibly adjust prices accordingly and users ewom in addition to social media impact web visibility is also playing a significant role holding a relevance of around 15 to the price model confirming previous studies eg yang et al 2014 therefore it is actually possible to accurately model accommodation prices in 14 hotels by including digital marketing variables on both social media and web visibility on searches which together accounted for 42 of influence on prices at least for the sample of gathered bookings such finding may be considered as a response to the research marketing agenda proposed by kannan 2016 to further enlighten on the influence of the most relevant features next paragraphs are devoted to analyze the ten features that encompass around 60 of relevance marked in white in table 8 figure 6 shows the pronounced effect that tripadvisor score has on price a previous study by jeong and mindy jeon 2008 also found a similar effect on hotels performance with experiments based on new york hotels therefore this finding provides further evidence that hotel managers are paying special attention to tripadvisor performance when deciding upon pricing strategies the increasing global awareness toward the most known online reviews platforms implies that tourists are making judged decisions based on others opinions hotel managers are particularly concerned with the undeniable power of tripadvisor ayeh et al 2013 while simultaneously they are trying to use it as a competitive advantage to boost the positive visibility of their units calheiros et al 2017 this dichotomy is expected to continue in the upcoming years the second most relevant feature discovered is the number of children included when booking the accommodation with a relevance of 740 almost 2 below the tripadvisor score emphasizing the influence of online reviews platforms in particular tripadvisor typically hotels may provide one or two extra beds in the same room by charging an additional fee results illustrated in figure 7 suggest that price increases from 101 to around 128 euros almost 27 above the original price while the second additional bed comes at a cost of around 34 over the price of a room with only one extra bed according to emel et al 2007 price 15 conscious travelers devote particular attention to the cost charged for extra beds thus managers should carefully balance the fees by minimizing the impact on consumers choice while aiming at a higher profit even in a small country such as portugal the location context plays a key role affecting hotels prices this is the third most relevant feature it is possible to observe from figure 8 that the capital and largest city lisboa charges the highest prices interestingly two highly promoted destinations with brand images known to online tourism oliveira 2013 namely cascais and sintra charge similar prices to lisboa the next three cities associated with higher prices are porto and coimbra the second and third largest portuguese cities and faro the algarve district capital highly potentiated by summer tourism andraz et al 2015 figure 9 shows that the number of stars positively affects price a widely known finding yacouel  fleischer 2012 while the star rate system is determined by independent entities it reflects a mixed evaluation of services offered features rate and satisfaction score thus higher ranked hotels are typically those that charge the highest price in terms of web visibility two features were also found to have an influence on price namely the number of hits when querying google with the city name plus the word hotel and the flag that indicates if the hotels website implements an online payment system for easing clients reservations for both the results are consistently expected hotels in cities appearing more often in google tend to charge higher prices figure 10 confirming citys relevance in pricing figure 5 also hotels offering online payment option charge higher prices figure 13 the two features exemplify the need to both appear as an appealing tourist destination in google while at the same time offering a complete online service to promote direct booking without depending on third 16 party platforms eg bookingcom furthermore the latter is associated with upscale hotels need to meet the expectations of a growing technology generation of tourists brochado et al 2016 with a relevance of 6 the number of days ahead of reservation is the sixth most relevant feature anticipating booking results in lower prices figure 11 as expected nevertheless scheduling more than a hundred days in advance seems to have a small effect on price fluctuation whereas as time goes by toward the date of reservation the effect becomes more pronounced also sun et al 2016 have found that room prices practiced by hong kong hotels increase sharply a week prior to checkin leading to hypothesize that a more mature market such as hong kong with high occupation rates acts on the price variable only closer to the predicted checkin date whereas the portuguese hospitality industry struggles more to attract tourists figure 12 shows the effect of the length of stay the seventh most relevant feature contributing with 542 of relevance on price fluctuation a lengthier stay implies a cost reduction on the price per day as expected since hotels invest in attracting tourists for longer periods to keep high occupancy rates nevertheless recent published literature holds conflicting results while masiero et al 2015 support our finding riasi et al 2017 discovered that on average hotels charge more per night when the guests stay longer however the former study considered bookings in switzerland while the latter considered them in the united states hence none of the results are directly comparable to the present study where portugal was the considered destination the facebook score holds a relation to room price ranging between around 120 and 150  figure 14 it seems that facebooks users tend to be more demanding with more expensive 17 hotels also experienced facebooks users are price sensitive best 2014 figure 15 shows that global brands offer lower prices which is an unexpected result considering branded hotels benefit from brand premium ivanov 2014 ivanova et al 2016 further studies on portuguese branded hotels are required to understand this localized phenomenon 5 conclusions implications and limitations the present research highlights that pricing encompasses a myriad of characteristics with all the 29 combined features playing a role in modeling price nevertheless tripadvisor score was found to have the most significant relevance almost 10 therefore hotel managers can easily use it as a proxy to analyze the range of prices practiced by the competition without needing to perform a more demanding pricing analysis there are some features directly controlled by hotels that managers believe to be an asset for which tourists are willing to pay more such as holding an online payment system in their website as well as some amenities however the latter seem to play a lesser relevant role in price definition than other features already widely studied in the literature such as those related to the geographical location of the hotel eg located in the city or near a beach also web visibility accounted for 15 of relevance when modeling prices clearly this is a confirmation that hotel managers are aware of the groundbreaking digital reality in todays world and are adjusting prices accordingly although dynamic pricing has been practiced in the hospitality industry for a while as it is possible to observe by the influence of the length of stay and the days ahead of reservation it is imperative for hoteliers to incorporate social media customer feedback when evaluating revenue management to reflect its impact on the practiced prices noone 2016 18 the present study has a few limitations that must be stated the most relevant one is that while the number of simulations is high the built dataset cannot encompass all possible scenarios an imposed limitation during the simulations was to set the age of children to four years old finally this study is countrybased nevertheless the procedure is replicable to any other geography thus a direction for future research is to build a price fluctuation model in other countries to understand how these behave 19 references alt r  zimmermann h d 2015 editorial 253 electronic markets on ecosystems and tourism electronic

menjadi bentuk kerajinan yang ada di kota manado usaha ini didirikan pada oktober tahun 2015 oleh ibu bertha mansauda yang beralamat di kelurahan meras lingkungan 3 kecamatan bunaken kota manado latar belakang berdirinya usaha adalah berawal dari pemilik yang mempunyai keterampilan membuat kerajinan sehingga dari keterampilan dan dengan tekad kuat maka ibu bertha mencoba untuk mendirikan usaha kerajinan bambut tutul yang diberi nama ud betris produksi ud betris pada awal berdiri usaha tidak terlalu banyak kegiatan produksi dilakukan setiap minggu dikarenakan belum adanya pelanggan tetap yang membeli produk kerajinan bambu tutul karena itu kegiatan produksi tidak dilakukan secara rutin kegiatan produksi kerajinan bambu tutul didasarkan pada pesanan dari konsumen pemilik usaha mempromosikan usahanya dengan mengunjungi tempattempat tertentu yang mempunyai peluang untuk membeli dalam jumlah yang besar setelah melakukan promosi diberbagai tempat hasil dari produksinya ibu bertha sendiri yang mendistribusikan ke tokotoko pusat perbelanjaan dinas sosial dan dinas pariwisata sekitar kota manado alat musik saxophone merupakan kerajinan pertama yang dibuat oleh beliau selanjutnya dikembangkan kerajinan gantungan kunci bunga dan rumah panggung minahasa semakin lama usaha ibu bertha semakin dikenal lokasi usaha keadaan disekitar lokasi usaha cukup baik dengan kata lain usaha ini tidak berpengaruh negatif terhadap masyarakat sekitar dan tidak mengganggu atau mencemari lingkungan sekitar usaha ini justru menjadi peluang dalam membantu masyarakat sekitar dalam hal penyerapan tenaga kerja karena pemilik usaha berasal dari masyarakat setempat lokasi usaha tidak begitu strategis hal ini dikarenakan lokasi tidak terlalu dekat dengan pusat kota sarana dan prasaranya tidak begitu menunjang seperti tidak dekat dengan pasar atau pertokoan dekat dengan jalan raya tetapi angkutan umum sangat terbatas sehingga untuk akses pembelanjaan dan pemasaran terlihat lambat

models in terms of prediction accuracy keywordsextreme learning machine least square support vector machine flower pollination algorithm earthquake prediction i introduction earthquake is movements and shaking inside the ground that produce energy in rocks like many natural disasters earthquake causes many damages financial loss and injuries 1 earthquakes happen daily in various regions around the world the more susceptible regions to earthshaking are japan 2 indonesia south california turkey iran and taiwan 3 people can feel the earthquake if its magnitude is more than 25 but if the magnitude is less than 25 the earthquake will not be felt the magnitude of highly caused damaged earthquakes is more than 45 4 sometimes earthquakes are responsible for huge numbers of deaths so scientists work hard in this field to prevent these severe effects the best effort is done to alert people in time because a wrong alert will cause unnecessary losses certainly people cannot stop the occurrence of earthquakes but they can adopt protective measures and precautions to minimize the deleterious effects by predicting earthquake magnitude using machine learning techniques there are a lot of methods that can be applied to predict earthquake magnitude using different sensors devices magnetic and electrical waves or seismic indicators obtained from the processing of the historical data of earthquakes 1 really there is no perfect model that results from 100 but at least a trial is made to improve the accuracy as much as possible 3 artificial intelligence plays an essential role in predicting and classifying problems a neural network is a very effective tool to solve complicated nonlinear issues 1 technology and machine learning provide many robust mechanisms to study seismic data and indicators data mining and machine learning are highly successful instrument in the prediction domain especially if massive data is required as weather forecasting stock prediction and so on 5 dataset plays an essential role in determining the purposed models quality and performance so we search a lot to choose the more exact dataset 4 there are thousands of machine learning algorithms but no one is always suitable for all issues because there are many factors that affect that like the number of features input indicators number of records of the dataset and type of problem classification or regression so we will apply some machine learning algorithms and compare their results with each other to determine the more suitable algorithm for this issue the comparison will be applied here to compare our work with other researchers that applied different machine learning algorithms on the same dataset 6 in this article the magnitude will be predicted using historical records of south california depending on the seismic indicators as an input for machine learning algorithms which are obtained from performing some statistical and mathematical equations on raw data time and magnitude 7 machine learning techniques can predict well if provided by a suitable dataset which is divided into 70for train and 30for test 8 in this paper elm lssvm and fpa will be used elm extreme learning machine is a straightforward algorithm because it depends on a feedforward neural network the data moves in one direction forward direction with only one hidden layer elm is a wellknown and wellresulted algorithm in 654  p a g e wwwijacsathesaiorg ijacsa international journal of advanced computer science and applications vol 12 no 5 2021 classification and regression domains unlike other ann algorithms that face the overfitting problem and the long running time problem elm overcomes these problems and can achieve high accuracy and highspeed results elm often uses a sigmoid function which will be applied in this work svm support vector machine is a wellknown deep learning tool for regression that depends on kernel methods giving high prediction results svm is a developed algorithm of machine learning to avoid ann shortages svm gives optimal global solutions avoiding local minima problems 9 lssvm least square support vector machine is the edited version of the svm algorithm lssvm simplifies the svm method but it needs kernel parameters which are important for regression problems so we need an appropriate way for the optimal choice of lssvm parameters so optimizing lssvm with fpa is done 9 fpa flower pollination algorithm was developed in 2012 by yang which uses pollination of flowers fpa was applied for many nonlinear problems giving high results 9 elm and ls svm are optimized by fpa flower pollination algorithm enhancing the accuracy and minimizing errors elm and lssvm are considered supervised learning where they take seven seismic parameters time is taken during the occurrence of n seismic indicators t average magnitude during n events mmean magnitude deficit which is the difference between the observed magnitude and expected one m the curve slope for n events using inverse power law of gutenberg richter b mean square deviation for n events using inverse power law of gutenberg richter  the square root of the released energy during t time de12 average mean time between events  10 as network inputs and produces the future magnitude as a network output to train well and be able to test after that no algorithm can predict 100 but some shortages of elm algorithm will be removed by using optimization swarm intelligence algorithm fpa to get fpa elm the result of optimizing elm with flower pollination algorithm which optimizes weights of input nodes and biases of a hidden layer of elm the optimization of svm with fpa is applied to enhance the performance of lssvm and get the fpals svm model that yields high results this work is divided into four parts the first part is processing the raw data to find the seismic indicators the second part is to input these indicators into machine learning algorithms to predict or output the expected future magnitude the third part is to optimize the output using artificial intelligence techniques swarm intelligence the fourth part is comparing different results using different algorithms in the rest of this paper the related work is showed in section ii applied algorithms in section iii data and parameters calculations in section iv methodology in section v results and discussion in section vi conclusion and future work in section vii and finally the references in machine learning and earthquake fields that is helpful in this work ii related work of course the earthquake catastrophe takes a large space of scientists interest so there are many kinds of research and scientists efforts which are spent in this domain researchers worldwide do their best to predict where and when the earthquake occurs depending on seismic indicators and other seismic electric signals using machine learning techniques and optimization algorithms adeli et al applied the probabilistic neural network on seismic indicators to predict the earthquake magnitude this model predicts well for magnitude from 45 to 6 in the southern california region 11 moustra et al who use the artificial neural network to predict earthquake occurrence using time series data and seismic electric signals in the greece region there are two case studies which finally led to when appropriate data presented to nn it can predict accurately 12 hegazy et al optimized elm with fpa flower pollination algorithm which shows a better accuracy when applied to prediction task 13 in this paper ma et al proposed a genetic algorithmbased neural network giving gann model is applied to six seismic indicators to find the relation between these indicators and the maximum earthquakes in china 14 maceda et al here svm is applied to earthquake problem this paper decided that svm is perfect for solving classification problems using a smallsize training dataset 15 li et al depended on the collected data from earthquake stations to be used in machine learning techniques to distinguish between earthquake and nonearthquake 16 rajguru et al optimized ann artificial neural network with ga genetic algorithm to predict the source location and dimensions of the earthquakes giving good results although the complexity of the problem 17 wang et al introduced a deep learning algorithm lstm to find the relation among the earthquakes in different places that is useful in earthquake prediction 18 reyes et al used an ann model to predict earthquake magnitude in a limited interval or bounded by threshold during the following five days applying statistical tests and experiments showed the higher success rate of that method than other machine learning classifiers 19 martnez lvarez et al used various seismic indicators as inputs for ann in different seismic zones and this showed that the seismic indicators are the best features for earthquake prediction 20 zhou et al showed how efficiently the neural network could predict the earthquake magnitude using the lmbp algorithm 21 moralesesteban et al used statistical methods and applied ann on earthquake in two seismic regions the western azoresgibraltar fault and the alborn sea whether the magnitude is limited in an interval or determined by threshold 22 wang et al proposed a rbfradial basis function neural network to earthquake prediction and the results showed that rbf is an effective tool for that nonlinear problem 23 alarifi et al used ann for earthquake prediction in the red sea region and the results showed the high ability of ann forecasting than any other statistical models 24 asenciocorts et al proposed a machine learning model to predict the earthquake magnitude after the next seven days using cloud infrastructure 25 tan et al proposed support vector machines svm and the results were good and added a new method for predicting earthquakes 26 florido et al interested in processing earthquake data in 655  p a g e wwwijacsathesaiorg ijacsa international journal of advanced computer science and applications vol 12 no 5 2021 chile the data were labeled by applying to clustering algorithms it was easy to identify earthquakes with a magnitude larger than 44 27 last et al used many data mining methods and time series to predict the magnitude of the highest earthquake event in the following year depending on data from the previous records using a multiobjective info fuzzy network algorithm 28 rafiei et al was interested in giving early alarm weeks before maximum earthquake event using classification algorithm ca combining with mathematical optimization algorithm oa whose role is to find the location of the earthquake with maximum magnitude 29 kerh et al used a genetic algorithm combined with a neural network to evaluate the response of the earthquake in taiwan that produces high results comparing to neural network model only 30 mirrashid et al used the system of adaptive neurofuzzy inference to predict the coming earthquakes with magnitude 55 or higher developed by three algorithms subtractive clustering sc grid partition gp and fuzzy c means fcm the results showed that the anfisfcm model gives the highest accuracy in predicting the magnitude of the earthquake 31 asim et al used many models of computational intelligence for earthquake prediction in northern pakistan and the feedforward neural network showed the highest performance compared with other models 32 umar et al combined the logistic regression lr with frequency ratio fr to overcome the limitations of each one individually this model achieved high success and good earthquake prediction in indonesia 33 asim et al focused on computing the seismic indicators mathematically and then applying the tree classifiers on them to predict the earthquake magnitude in hindu kush showing that the rotation forest gave a good prediction than random forest 34 machine learning ml methods such as artificial neural networks anns support vector machines svms extreme learning machine elm are considered the most commonly used ml models in classification regression but these methods may suffer from local minima and overfitting problems due to using local optimization training algorithms such as gradient descent algorithm in ann 35 swarm intelligence algorithms such as particle swarm optimization pso follower pollination algorithm fpa ant colony optimization aco and artificial bee colony abc can solve the problems or drawbacks of machine learning models such as ann svm and elm methods 3637 using swarm intelligence or metaheuristic algorithms in optimizing and training classical machine learning models can enhance the accuracy and generalization ability of these methods 3843 iii preliminaries a elm extreme learning machine this model is a feedforward neural network with only one hidden layer a very rapid learning method with solutions for many problems caused by traditional neural network algorithms like overfitting local minima slowness achieving better performance higher accuracy elm is a simple model that is performed through three steps  first step elm chooses the weights of input nodes and hidden biases randomly  second step elm performs calculations to generate the output matrix of the hidden layer  third step calculations of the output weight elm uses a single hidden layer with n hidden nodes and fx the activation function to learn distinct samples m                     after that the nonlinear problem is turned to the linear problem ht 1 the hidden output matrix h is defined as follow h                               2 where          is the weight vector between input nodes and hidden ones  is the bias of hidden nodes where j 12 n    where i1m is the inner product of              is output weights matrix but           where j 123n is the vector of weights connecting the output neuron and a jth hidden one          is targets matrix the errors between the estimated value  and the real value  equal to zero using the following formula            3 weights that link between the hidden layer and output one are estimated by the least square solution to the linear problem using the following formula bt 4 where  is the inverse of the h matrix using the moore penrose method that makes elm perform better and faster 13 b lssvm least square support vector machine it is one of deep and supervised learning that can classify data and predict values lssvm is the new version of svm that solves svm issues using lssvm the solution can be founded by solving some linear equations rather than a quadratic programming problem used in svm let x is the matrix of input data using training data lssvm plays a good role in creating the function that shows the dependence of the output on the input the formula of this function fx  x b 5 where w  x   are column vectors with size n1 and b   now lssvm calculates that function using the same minimization problem in svm showing the important difference that lssvm contains equality constraints unlike inequality ones in svm lssvm depends on the least square function 9 we can minimize the error using this optimization formula min jweb   w  c    6 656  p a g e wwwijacsathesaiorg ijacsa international journal of advanced computer science and applications vol 12 no 5 2021    b  7 where e

occurred in 90 of flowers by the spread of pollens using various insects and abiotic pollination which occurred in 10 of flowers where the pollens move through water or wind two methods do the pollination selfpollination occurs when the flowers pollen moves to the same flower or different flowers at the same plant crosspollination occurs when the pollen of one flower of a specified plant moves to another flower in a different plant the steps of the fpa algorithm  the crosspollination biotic is called global pollination where the levy fight takes place  selfpollination is considered as local pollination  the constancy of the flower can be treated as the probability of reproduction is proportional to two flowers similarity  there is a switch probability p  01 that determines the

abstract earthquake prediction has been a challenging research area where a future occurrence of the devastating catastrophe is predicted in this work sixty seismic features are computed through employing seismological concepts such as gutenbergrichter law seismic rate changes foreshock frequency seismic energy release total recurrence time further maxi mum relevance and minimum redundancy mrmr criteria is applied to extract the rele vant features a support vector regressor svr and hybrid neural network hnn based classification system is built to obtain the earthquake predictions hnn is a step wise combi nation of three different neural networks supported by enhanced particle swarm optimiza tion epso to offer weight optimization at each layer the newly computed seismic features in combination with svrhnn prediction system is applied on hindukush chile and southern california regions the obtained numerical results show improved prediction performance for all the considered regions compared to previous prediction studies 1 introduction earthquakes are one of the major catastrophe and their unpredictability causes even more destruction in terms of human life and financial losses there has been a serious debate about the predictability of earthquakes with two concurrent point of views related to their prediction one school of thought considers it impossible phenomenon to predict while other have spent their resources and efforts to achieve this task it is an undeniable fact that the seismologist community has been unsuccessful in developing methods to predict earthquakes despite more than a century of efforts earthquake prediction remained an unachieved objective due to sev eral reasons one of the reasons is the lack of technology in accurately monitoring the stress changes pressure and temperature variations deep beneath the crust through scientific instru ments which eventually results in unavailability of comprehensive data about seismic features the second probable cause is the gap between seismologists and computer scientist for explor ing the various venues of technology to hunt this challenging task with the advent of modern computer science based intelligent algorithms significant results have been achieved in differ ent fields of research such as weather forecasting 1 churn prediction 2 and disease diagno sis 3 therefore by bridging gap between computer science and seismology substantial outcomes may be achieved plos one  httpsdoiorg101371journalpone0199004 july 5 2018 1  22 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111

diverse techniques retrospective studies of various earthquake precursory phenom ena show anomalous trends corresponding to earthquakes such as subsoil radon gas emission 4 total electron content of ionosphere 5 vertical electric field magnetic field of earth 6 and so forth the bright aspect of recent achievements is the encouraging results for earth quake prediction achieved through computational intelligence ci and artificial neural net works ann in combination with seismic parameters 712 thus initiating new lines of research and ideas to explore for earthquake prediction there is a slight difference between earthquake prediction and earthquake forecasting it is a continuously evolving concept with various definitions stated in literature 13 in the view of authors earthquake forecasting relates to the concept in which a certain probability of future earthquake occurrence is given while prediction means that earthquake prediction is made in the form of yes or no without any associated probability factor irrespective of confidence in prediction earthquake prediction problem is initially considered as a time series prediction 14 later seismic parameters are mathematically calculated on the basis of wellknown seismic laws and facts corresponding to every target earthquake et the calculation of seismic parameters cor responding to every et provides a feature vector related to et thus earthquake prediction is carried out on the basis of computed features in place of time series of earthquakes thereby converting a time series prediction problem into a classification problem the mathematically calculated seismic parameters are basically meant to represent the internal geological state of the ground before earthquake occurrence this research work employs the known mathemati cal methods and computes all the seismic features in a bid to retain maximum information which leads to sixty seismic features corresponding to every earthquake occurrence et after acquiring maximum available seismic features maximum relevancy and minimum redun dancy mrmr based feature selection is applied to select most relevant feature having maxi mum information support vector regression svr followed by hybrid neural network hnn model and enhanced particle swarm optimization epso is applied to model rela tionship between feature vectors and their corresponding et thereby generating robust earth quake prediction model svrhnn the distinctive contributions of this research methodology is summarized as i sixty seismic features calculated on the principle of retaining maximum information ii a unique application of svr in combination with hnn on mrmr selected seismic features hindukush chile and southern california are three of the most active seismic regions in the world thus considered in this study for studying problem of earthquake prediction earth quake prediction studies based on artificial neural networks ann have been performed on the considered seismic regions 9 11 15 the proposed prediction methodology is separately applied to perform earthquake predictions for the said regions and results are evaluated the suggested earthquake prediction model showed improved results as compared to the other models proposed for these regions the rest of the manuscript is structured as the section 2 contains literature survey

changes in subsoil emission vertical electric field and ionosphere these precursory changes are studied and mapped retrospectively with major earthquakes 4 5 earthquake prediction is also studied through observing behavioral changes in animals 16 the animal behavioral study is carried out using motiontriggered cameras at yanachaga national park peru the decline in animal activity has been observed prior to contamana earthquake of magnitude 70 in 2011 however the focus of this research is to study earthquake prediction through computational intelligence and machine learning based

earthquake forecasting the study analyzes the earthquake catalog and gives the alarming area in circular region for next five years 17 18 there are several studies conducted based on this algorithm and its advanced stabilized version ie m8s algorithm to forecast the seismic events of magnitude 55 and above 19 the three dimensional pattern informatics pi approach is also applied which aims at the forecast of earthquakes with natural and synthetic data sets 20 considering the regional seis mic environment the method efficiently characterizes the spatial and temporal seismic activity patterns with angular allusion occurred in the extent of associated space this technique is the improved version of two dimensional pi approach 21 in the sense that it resolves the verti cally distributed seismic anomalies in the presence of complex tectonic structures moreover it gives forecast by systematically analyzing the anomalous behaviors in the seismicity at regional level in another research work the earthquake prediction for the regions of southern california and san francisco bay area have also been studied eight seismic parameters are mathemati cally calculated through the temporal sequence of past seismicity the seismic parameters are then used in combination with recurrent neural networks rnn back propagation neural network bpnn and radial basis functions rbf separately rnn yielded better results as compare to the other two applied neural networks 9 later the probabilistic neural network pnn has been applied for the same regions in combination with same seismic parameters 8 where pnn is reported to have produced better results for earthquakes of magnitude less than 60 than rnn a similar approach with same eight seismic parameters has also been used to perform earthquake prediction for hindukush region 11 pattern recognition neural net work prnn is reported to have outperformed other classifiers such as rnn random forest and lpboost ensemble of trees for hindukush region earthquake magnitude prediction for northern red sea area is carried out in 22 the methodology is based on the features extraction from the past available earthquake records

seismic events for next year all the aforementioned methodologies study the earthquake prediction while focusing only one region the prediction models are not applied and tested to other earthquake prone regions and no comparisons are also carried out with the results of other research studies in this research the prediction model is applied to more than one region and comparisons are also drawn with the results available in literature 3 regions selection and feature calculation 31 region selection and earthquake catalog in this study three different regions namely hindukush chile southern california have been selected for prediction of earthquakes of magnitude 50 and above the same regions selected in the precedent studies are also considered for this research 9 11 15 the advantage of selecting the same regions is that results can be compared in the end so as to prove the superi ority of suggested methodology earthquake catalogs of these regions have been obtained from united states geological sur vey usgs 28 for the period from january 1980 to december 2016 these catalogs are ini tially evaluated for cutoff magnitude cutoff magnitude corresponds to the earthquake magnitude in the catalog above which catalog is complete and no seismic event is missing this depends upon the level of instrumentation dense instrumentation in a region leads to better completeness of catalog with low cutoff magnitude the cutoff magnitude for south ern california region is found to be less than 26 for chile it is 34 and for hindukush it is 40 the completeness of magnitude for all three regions shows the density of instrumentation in these regions there are different methodologies proposed in literature for evaluation of cut off magnitude 29 in this study cutoff magnitude is determined through gutenbergrichter law the point where curve deviates from exponential behavior is selected as a cutoff magni tude all the events reported below cutoff magnitude are removed from the catalog before using for parameter calculation earthquake magnitudes and frequency of occurrences for each region is plotted as shown in fig 1 the curves follow decreasing exponential behavior which assures that each catalog is complete to its respective cutoff magnitude after parameter calculation a feature vector is obtained corresponding to every target earth quake et in this study earthquake prediction problem is designedmodeled as a binary clas sification problem every earthquake magnitude is converted to yes no 1 0 through applying threshold on magnitude 50 it is too early in this field of research to predict actual magnitudes of future earthquakes however endeavors are on the way to predict the categories of future events svrhnn for earthquake prediction plos one

quality of catalog directly affects the prediction results further processes involved are feature calculation selection training of model and finally predictions are obtained on unseen part of dataset in the end performance of prediction model is evalu ated and comparison is drawn 32 parameter calculation features are the most important part of a classification problem in this study features are also referred as seismic parameters these seismic parameters are calculated mathematically and are based upon wellknown geophysical and seismological facts there are different geophys ical and seismic parameters suggested in literature for earthquake prediction studies employ ing computational intelligence 9 15 26 discovering new geophysical and seismological facts leading to earthquake prediction is another aspect of earthquake prediction studies which is currently not included in the scope of this research work seismic parameters calcu lated in this research are broadly classified into two main categories with regards of calculation perspective which are defined as  the seismic features whose calculation is not dependent upon any variable parameter are called nonparametric seismic features  the seismic features whose calculation is dependent upon any variable parameter such as a threshold are called parametric seismic features the important contribution of this research from the perspective of seismic parameters are 1 all the available geophysical and seismological features employed for earthquake prediction in contemporary literature are taken into account simultaneously which has never been done before fig 2 flow chart of research methodology httpsdoiorg101371journalpone0199004g002 svrhnn for earthquake prediction plos one  httpsdoiorg101371journalpone0199004 july 5 2018 6  22 2 multiple values of parametric seismic features have been calculated based upon different variations of a variable parameter in order to retain maximum available information about the internal geological state of the ground all the seismic features are calculated using the 50 seismic events before the event of interest et which is to be predicted using the feature vector the numbers of features reach to 60 in every instance according to suggested methodology later in order to handle the issues related to curse of dimensionality the feature selection technique based on maximum relevance and minimum redundancy mrmr is employed to choose the features having maximum rele vant and discriminating information 321 nonparametric seismic features as the calculation of nonparametric seismic fea tures is not dependent on any variable parameter thus such variables have one possible value for every instance  a and b value these values are directly based on wellknown geophysical law known as gutenbergrich ter law according to this law number of earthquakes increase exponentially with decreasing magnitude mathematically shown in eq 1 where ni is the total number of seismic events cor responding to magnitude mi b is slope of curve and a is yintercept logni  a  bmi 1 the values of a and b are calculated numerically through two different methods eqs 2 and 3 represent the linear least square regression lsq while eqs 4 and 5 show the maximum likeli hood mlk method for calculation of a and b values in earthquake prediction study for south ern california

if the energy release stops the phenomenon is known as quiescence which may release in the form of major event state of quiescence may also lead to the reduction in seismic rate for the region thereby decreasing b value de 1 2  x 1011815m 1 2 t 6 svrhnn for earthquake prediction plos one  httpsdoiorg101371journalpone0199004 july 5 2018 7  22  time of n events time t in days during which n number

usually the magnitude of seismic events rise before any larger earthquake mmean  x i m n 8  seismic rate changes seismic rate change is the overall increase or decrease in the seismic behavior of the region for two difference intervals of time there are two ways proposed to calculate seismic rate changes z value shown in eq 9 measures seismic rate change as proposed by 30 where r1 and r2 correspond the seismic rate for two different intervals s1 and s2 represent the standard deviation of rate n1 and n2 show the number of seismic event in both intervals z  r1  r2  s1 n1  s2 n2 q 9 the other way for seismic rate change calculation is suggested in 31 and given in eq10 where n represents total events in the whole earthquake dataset t is total time duration and  is the normalized

as x6i the representation of this parameter is also kept the same as that of literature so as to maintain better continuity it is mathematically represented as given in eq 11 x6i  maxfmig when t 2 7 0 11 thus the total number of seismic parameters obtained from nonparametric features is accounted to 10 322 parametric features the formulae for parametric features contain a varying param eter such as earthquake magnitude or b value all these features are calculated through svrhnn for earthquake prediction plos one  httpsdoiorg101371journalpone0199004 july 5 2018 8  22 multiple available values of varying parameter the details of all the parametric features are given below  probability of earthquake occurrence the probability of earthquake occurrence of magnitude greater than or equal to 60 is also taken as an important seismic feature it is represented by x7i and calculated through eq 12 the inclusion of this feature supports the inclusion of gutenbergrichter law in an indirect way the value of x7i is dependent upon b value therefore blsq and bmlk are separately used to calculate x7i thus giving two different values for this seismic feature x7i  e 3bi loge 12  deviation from gutenbergricher law it is the deviation  of actual data from the gutenbergrichter inverse law as shown in eq 13 this feature indicates how much actual data follows the inverse law of distribution its

httpsdoiorg101371journalpone0199004 july 5 2018 9  22 increase with increasing magnitude available literature does not focus on which value of m0 to be selected in such a scenario therefore tr is calculated for every m0 from 40 to 60 magni tudes following the principle of retaining maximum available information so for two sets of a and b values along with varying m0 adds 42 seismic features to the dataset tr  t 10abm0 17 4 earthquake prediction model unlike previous other simple earthquake prediction models proposed in literature in this paper a multistep prediction model is suggested svrhnn it is a combination of various machine learning techniques with every technique complementing the other through knowl edge acquired during learning thus every step in this model is adding further improvements to the robustness therefore resulting in a final improved version of prediction model the lay out of overall prediction model is given in fig 2 dataset obtained for all the three regions is divided into training and testing sets for training and validation purposes 70 of the dataset is selected while testing is performed on rest of 30 hold out dataset the final results shown in section 5 are the prediction results obtained on test dataset for every region separately the configurations and setups arranged in order to train a model are kept same for all three regions datasets however separate training has been performed for each region the reason for separate training is that every region has different properties and can be classified tectoni cally into different categories such as thrusting tectonics strikeslip tectonics and so forth therefore every type of region possess different behaviors and relations to the earthquakes thus separate training for every region is meant to learn and model the relationship between seismic features and earthquakes for that particular region the proposed methodology includes the use of two step feature selection process the fea tures are selected after performing relevancy and redundancy checks to make sure that only useful features are employed for earthquake prediction the selected set of features are then passed to support vector regression svr the trend predicted by svr is further used in combination with seismic features as input to the next stage of prediction model ie ann the inclusion of svroutput as a feature to ann is to pass on the information learnt through svr after svr three different layers of neural networks are applied to the dataset in combi nation with enhanced particle swarm optimization epso the output of every ann is used as an input to the next ann in place of svroutput along with feature set the weight adjust ments of each ann layer is also passed to the next ann so that next ann does not start learning from scratch the purpose of including epso is to optimize the weights of ann which have tendency to get trapped in local minima if during training ann is stuck in local minima epso plays a vital role in that scenario the similar type of approach has also been used in other fields such as wind power prediction 32 33 with successful outcomes the flowchart of earthquake prediction methodology is provided in fig 3 41 feature selection the total number of 60 seismic features are computed for every instance the approach of fea ture calculation is useful that tends to gather maximum obtainable information however a reduced feature set can be selected for learning process instead of utilizing the complete set of 60 features the features having less discriminating information or redundant information can be excluded in order to deal with such a situation two step feature selection is applied based on maximum relevance and minimum redundancy after the calculation of all available features mrmr method selects the features having most relevant and discriminating information this svrhnn for earthquake prediction plos one  httpsdoiorg101371journalpone0199004 july 5 2018 10  22 step also helps in avoiding the curse of dimensionality problem which is a major issue in machine learning algorithms feature selection step is embedded as a part of prediction model because it is separately applied for each dataset the different seismic regions considered in this study represent varying seismic properties recorded as per calculated features and thus results in different seismic datasets a feature in hindukush dataset having insignificant information content may possess opposite trend for chile or southern california which can actually be observed when feature selection is applied for all these regions therefore it is inappropriate to declare features selected for a specific region to be best for all the other regions 411 maximum relevance irrelevancy filter is first of the two steps of feature selection it removes all the features that are irrelevant and having less information content to be useful for prediction it is proposed in 34 while certain modifications in its formulation is suggested in 35 this technique has already been used for feature selection in different classification prob lems such as medical image processing cancer classification however it has been used for the first time for seismic feature selection the methodology includes calculation of mutual information mi of every feature corresponding to target earthquakes et in binary form a suitable threshold is applied on mi and all the features having mi less than the threshold are ignored the value of threshold is kept fixed in this model for the considered earthquake datasets irrelevancy criterion filters out different features for all the three regions for hindukush region 5 features are filtered out after this step and rest of 55 features are passed to the next step similarly for dataset of chile 4 features are excluded through irrelevance filter and 56 are passed to next step in southern california dataset 55 features are considered fit for the next step after leaving out 05 features 412 minimum redundancy there are features which are showing redundant informa tion in the dataset therefore the inclusion of such features for earthquake prediction is of no use removing the features with redundant information is the second phase in feature selec tion the idea of feature redundancy filter is proposed in 34 and certain changes in the implementation are given in 32 the basic idea behind this technique is that mi is calculated fig 3 flow chart of earthquake prediction model httpsdoiorg101371journalpone0199004g003 svrhnn for earthquake prediction plos one  httpsdoiorg101371journalpone0199004 july 5 2018 11  22 inbetween all the features any two features possessing maximum mi are considered to be having redundant information therefore a certain redundancy criterion rc is empirically selected and kept fixed in the learning process for all the three regions like irrelevancy filter this technique may show different results for every region in hindu kush dataset out of 55 relevant features 32 are found to be redundant and left out therefore leaving behind 23 effective features similarly chiles dataset contains 42 redundant features out of 56 relevant features and leaving behind 14 useful features and for southern california dataset 25 useful features are selected after excluding 30 redundant features 42 support vector regression svr is a machine learning technique that learns in a supervised manner it is first proposed in 36 and implementation is carried out using libsvm a library for support vector machine 37 svr has wide range of applications for both classification as well as regression problems the model generated through training of svr gives predictions about an estimated earth quake magnitude corresponding to the feature vectors svr then imparts its knowledge of pre dicted earthquake magnitudes to hnn in next step through auxiliary predictions to be used as a part of feature set experiments have proven that the auxiliary predictions from svr when used in combination with features adds a distinctive classification capability to the prediction model 43 enhanced particle swarm optimization there are different natureinspired optimization algorithms in literature 3844 however epso has been employed in this study for weight optimization of ann epso is an evolution ary algorithm the idea of particle swarm optimization pso is given in 45 in this optimiza tion methodology exploration is carried out for finding the best possible solution or position in the search space like a bird or an organism searches for food different factors affect the hunt for best possible solution like current position and velocity the record of best local posi ton global position and worst global position is also kept for generating optimized solution epso is also a wellconsidered an optimization methodology which is being used in different application fields and explained in detail in 32 44 hybrid neural networks the next step of prediction model is to train hybrid neural network model this step is the combination of three different anns along with optimization support extended from epso the training is carried out through 1st ann and weights are then passed to epso for further optimization in case if ann is stuck in local minima epso has the capability to guide it out from this situation the optimization measure for epso is set to matthews correlation coeffi cient mcc if the ann has already learnt the best possible relation between features and earthquakes epso would return the same weight matrix thus it can be said that epso is included in this methodology to save anns from being trapped in local minima the training of this step is carried out for a binary classification problem in which inten tion is to predict the earthquakes of magnitude 50 and above initially the dataset along with auxiliary prediction from svr is passed to levenbergmarquardt neural network the net work trains in back propagation manner where error at the output layer is back propagated in every epoch when the training stops the weight matrices are passed to epso along with training features and targets epso optimizes the weights in terms of mcc and returns the optimized weights back to ann the predictions from optimized weights of epso are taken as auxiliary predictions in place of svroutput to be used along with features for next ann svrhnn for earthquake prediction plos one  httpsdoiorg101371journalpone0199004 july 5 2018 12  22 bfgs quasinewton backpropagation neural network bfgsnn is initialized with the weights of previously learnt nn in this way the already learnt information is transferred to the next nn along with auxiliary predictors the network is trained similarly and the weights along with training data are passed to epso for optimization via mcc the optimized weights are then used to initialize bayesian regularization neural network brnn and training data is passed in combination with bfgsnn auxiliary predictors epso is again employed to opti

evaluation  svrhnnmodeltest dataset actual labels in this work the output of svr is treated as its own opinion about the earthquake occur rence thus in a bid to improve the performance of earthquake prediction a combination of three anns and epso called as hybrid neural network hnn is formulated seismic features are passed to hnn for yielding the predictions at this point of stage the results obtained through svr are considered as auxiliary predictions and passed on to hnn along with other features the opinion of svr would also hold importance in terms of discriminating power between earthquake and nonearthquake occurrences therefore when coupled with dataset of other seismic features it highly improves the discriminating power of earthquake pre diction resulting in improved prediction performance of hnn in hnn the weights and out puts of each ann is passed to the next layer of ann to make the consequent layer start learning ahead of a certain point thus the feedback of svr or ann at a specific layer enhance the learning of hnn leading to the improved earthquake prediction the role of epso is to res cue ann when it is trapped in local minima through optimizing the weights however in case when ann is performing well the epso refrains from updating the weight the model is trained using 70 of feature instances and later independent testing is performed on unseen 30 of data in the training data twothird part is used for training the algorithm while one third is used for validation of model the evaluation of model is performed on unseen feature instances through considering wellknown evaluation measures svrhnn for earthquake prediction plos one  httpsdoiorg101371journalpone0199004 july 5 2018 13  22 5 results and discussion there are total 7656 feature instances for chile out of which 2067 correspond to yes earth quake while 5589 correspond to no earthquake the total instances for southern california are 33543 out of which 7671 belong to yes earthquake while 25872 belong to no earth quake similarly for hindukush dataset out of 4350 instances 1379 correspond to yes while 2971 correspond to no therefore the data distributions of the considered regions are highly imbalanced as shown in fig 4 51 performance evaluation criteria there are wellknown performance metrics available for evaluation of binary classification results such as sensitivity specificity positive predictive value or precision p1 negative pre dictive value p2 matthews correlation coefficient mcc and r score whenever predictions are made through an algorithm it yields four categories of outputs namely true positive tp false positive fp true negative tp and false negative fn tp and tn are the correct pre dictions made by the prediction model while fp and fn are the wrong predictions of the algorithm sensitivity sn is the rate of true positive predictions out of all positive instances while spec ificity sp is the rate of true negative predictions out among all negative instances p1 is the ratio of correct positive predictions out of all the positive predictions made by prediction model whereas p0 refers to the correct negative predictions made by

which refers higher p1 means lesser false alarms and vice versa similarly r score and mcc are also proposed as a balanced mea sure for binary classification evaluation these are calculated using all four basic measures tp fp tn fn and vary between 1 and 1 the values approaching 1 correspond to perfect classification while 0 refers to total random behavior of prediction algorithm and 1 relates to opposite behavior of classification model these two performance measures can be considered as a benchmark measure for drawing comparison because the four types of basic measures are also incorporated in them as shown in eqs 22 and 23 accuracy is a very general criterion for evaluation used in many perspectives it states the overall accurate predictions made by the algorithm the purpose of analyzing the same results through these mentioned criteria is that each per formance metric highlights certain aspect of results therefore the purpose is to highlight all the merits and demerits of

all three regions using 70 of all the datasets prediction results are evaluated for all the regions accuracy is used for performance evalua tion in many aspects but in unbalanced classification problems it may not be the best choice to only use accuracy for evaluation when in a dataset one class is in abundance and other is less it is said to be unbalanced dataset for example in a dataset of 100 instances if only 10 instances correspond to earthquake occurrence while rest of 90 belong to noearthquake then a prediction algorithm with minimal prediction capability predicts all of them as noearth quakes in this scenario the algorithm has no knowledge of predictability but its accuracy would still be 90 therefore misguiding the overall capability of prediction model however mcc and r score would yield 0 value for this scenario thereby giving better insights into the competence of prediction model this is the reason different aspects of a prediction model is evaluated for better analysis earthquake prediction is highly delicate issue and false alarms svrhnn for earthquake prediction plos one  httpsdoiorg101371journalpone0199004 july 5 2018 15  22 may lead to financial loss and cause panic therefore cannot be tolerated a prediction model with even less than 50 sensitivity but better p1 is preferable over another prediction model having around 90 sensitivity but lesser p1 considering the fact that there exists no earth quake prediction system till date thus results obtained through svrhnn model are commendable 521 predictions for hindukush region asim et al 11 carried out earthquake predic tion studies for hindukush region where considerable prediction results are obtained through different machine learning techniques pattern recognition neural networks prnn yields better results than other discussed methods therefore prnn is chosen in this work for com parison with svrhnn based prediction methodology table 1 shows that svrhnn based prediction results are outperforming prnn based predictions by wide margin in all aspects except sensitivity the value of mcc has been improved considerably from 033 to 06 and r score from 027 to 058 improvement is also observed in p1 from 61 to above 75 thus improving false alarm generation for hindukush region from 39 to less than 25 decreased sensitivity is acceptable with notable improvement in p1 mcc r score and accuracy a model with increased sensitivity may sensitize false earthquakes leading to the generation of false alarms therefore a model robust towards false alarms may have less sensitivity which is acceptable given the other performance evaluation criteria have improved 522 predictions for chile region the results are even more improved for chile region through svrhnn based prediction model previously reyes et al 15 carried out earth quake prediction for four chilean regions through applying different machine learning tech niques with ann achieving the best results the ann based results for all the chilean regions are averaged average of tps fps tns and fns in this study for drawing comparison with svrann based results the proposed svrhnn approach has underperformed the ann based chilean results in the all aspects by considerable margins except marginal difference in specificity as evident from table 2 false alarm generation reduced from 39 to less than 27 along with 5 increase in accuracy as well the considerable difference can be observed in mcc and r score which increased from 039 to 061 and 034 to 060 respectively table 2 earthquake prediction results for chile

california region is consid ered earlier for earthquake prediction using ann by panakkat and adeli 9 recurrent neural network rnn is reported to have produced better results in terms of r score the results were evaluated in terms of false alarms ratio far probability of detection pod or sensitiv ity frequency bias fb and r score to discuss the results through the same evaluation crite ria the values of basic performance parameters tp tn fp and fn are calculated through set of four equations of far pod fb and r score after calculating basic performance parameters other evaluation criteria are calculated and given in table 3 the results generated through svrhnn based methodology are better than rnn based results of 9 false alarm generation are decreased considerably from 29 to less than 7 a noteworthy increase in mcc and r score is also observed from 051 to 0722 and 051 to 062 respectively hence proving the svrhnn based prediction methodology better than already available prediction models svrhnn is outperforming previous prediction models because it is a multilayer model with every layer adding to its robustness svr provides initial estimation of the earth quake predictions which is further refined by three different anns and epso supporting it through optimization 524 interregional comparison of earthquake prediction svrhnn based prediction model has shown improved results for southern california as compared to the other two regions with 0722 0623 and 906 of mcc r score and accuracy respectively while chilean region is holding second best position with mcc of 0613 r score of 0603 and accuracy of 849 the svrhnn based proposed model has shown least results for the hindukush region with mcc r score and accuracy of 06 058 and 827 respectively fig 5 graphically compares the prediction results for all the three regions scaled between 0 and 1 this interregion results comparison has led to the practical visualization of the fact that lower cutoff magnitude and better completeness of earthquake catalog would lead to the improved results for earthquake prediction the completeness magnitude of southern california is taken as 26 for chile its 34 and for hindukush its 40 hence demonstrated that earthquake prediction results are inversely related to the cutoff magnitude in other words it can be inferred that dense instrumentation for earthquake monitoring plays key role for better earthquake prediction the overall achievements of this study are presented as 1 svrhnn based prediction methodology generated considerably improved results for hindukush chile and southern california it has exceedingly outperformed other available predictions results in literature 2 interregional comparison of prediction results shows that the region with better main tained earthquake catalog having low cutoff magnitude is capable of generating better pre diction results it highlights the need of better instrumentation for earthquake catalog

svrhnn in order to prove the superiority of svrhnn model the earthquake prediction performance is also computed sep arately using svr and hnn an independent arrangement has been made to get the earth quake prediction results for svr and hnn the performance of svr and hnn is compared with the combine results of both svrhnn a notable difference between the performances of individual techniques and their combination can be observed mcc of 043 and 041 is obtained for hindukush region using svr and hnn respectively the combination of two techniques by including svr as auxiliary predictor for hnn improves mcc to 058 a similar trend in improvement is also observed for other performance measures as shown in table 4 for the three considered regions thereby proving the superiority of svrhnn over their sep arate counter parts the role of epso is to optimize the weights of neural networks artificial neural networks have tendency of getting trapped in local minima if such a situation happens during the train ing of a neural network epso helps ann in escaping local minima and guides in towards optimum solution but this is not the case every time that ann is trapped in local minima it may happen occasionally if ann is already performing well and learning in the right direc tion the inclusion of epso does not affect the weights of ann in such a situation the term hnn stands for combination of three different neural networks coupled with epso some times hnn without epso would show the similar results as compare to hnn with epso however on some other training occasions it may show lesser performance fig 5 interregional comparison of earthquake prediction results for three regions httpsdoiorg101371journalpone0199004g005 table 4 performance comparison of svr hnn with svrhnn

are dependent on respective parameter selection thus the collective performance obtained in svrhnn model is governed through selection of appropriate parameter values the extensive experimentation is performed to empirically select the values for parameters which obtain good results for each of the used algorithms svr hnn and epso the proposed model has shown consistent performance for the three regions which approves the appropriate selection of values for parameters the ten simulation runs of svrhnn model show little variation which strength ens the claim of appropriate selection of parametric values leading to a stable earthquake pre diction performance in three regions the graphs given in fig 6 show the performance stability of svrhnn model for the three considered regions conclusions in this study interdisciplinary research has been carried out for earthquake prediction through interaction of seismologybased earthquake precursors and computer science based computa tional intelligent techniques a robust multilayer prediction model is generated in combina tion with the computation of maximum obtainable seismic features sixty seismic features are computed for hindukush chile and southern california regions separate feature selection is performed for every region through maximum relevance and minimum redundancy mrmr approach the selected features are

anatolian fault in turkey abstract a method that exactly knows the earthquakes beforehand and can generalize them cannot still been developed however earthquakes are tried to be predicted through numerous methods one of these methods artificial neural networks give appropriate outputs to different patterns by learning the relationship between the determined inputs and outputs in this study a feedforward back propagation artificial neural network that is connected to gutenbergrichter relationship and that bases on b value used in earthquake predictions was developed the artificial neural network was trained employing earthquake data belonging to four different regions which have intensive seismic activity in the west of turkey after the training process the earthquake data belonging to later dates of the same regions were used for testing and the performance of the network was put forward when the prediction results of the developed network are examined the prediction results that the network predicts that an earthquake is not going to occur are quite high in all regions furthermore the earthquake prediction results that the network predicts that an earthquake is going to occur are different to some extent for the studied regions keywords earthquake prediction artifical neural networks feed forward back propagation ann doi 1017823gusb352 1 bu alma 2016 ylnda gmhane

earthquake prediction is an extraordinarily stochastic process de termining the occurrence time location of epicenter and magnitude of a coming earthquake in the following month is an extremely dicult task nowadays some geophysical statistical and machine learning methods are adopted to predict earth quakes however for the insucient mediumlarge seismic data their results are not satisfactory due to there is no obvious empirical relationship between seismic ity features magnitude and location of a coming earthquake in a particular time window an earthquake prediction approach based on danger theory is proposed in this paper it extracts eight indicators calculated from earthquake data for recent years in sichuan and surroundings by gutenbergrichtergr inverse powerlaw and predicts quakes with magnitude lager than 45 during the following month by numerical dierential based dendritic cell algorithm nddca we compare this approach with six stateofart earthquake prediction algorithms overall our algo rithm yields the encouraging results in all the qualied parameters assessed and it provides technical support for the application of earthquake prediction key words danger theory

rence time of future earthquakes 1 for impermeability the rarity of earthquakes and the complexity of physical processes earthquake magnitude is dicult to pre dict and then resulting in vast loss of

active cities with more than 200 earthquakes with magnitude greater than 3 occurring per year the most recent major earthquakes include the 2008 wenchuan earthquake 2013 yaan earthquake and 2017 jiuzhaigou earthquake 2 the plate movement results in seismic activity of sichuan and it locates at longmenshan fault zone which is formed by the active motion of india plate to eurasian plate since the sichuan provinces special geological structure earthquake prediction of sichuan and surroundings may be a problem worth studying with the development of intelligent technology seismologists begin to intro duce intelligent methods to build earthquake prediction models shi and liu 3 were pioneers in introducing neural network into earthquake prediction and the relationship between magnitude and epicentral intensity of an earthquake is es tablished in the paper nevertheless the method has poor performance in 2015 asenciocortes et al 4 adopted the principal component analysis pca for data dimensionality reduction and new datasets generated so as to generalize the exist prediction model however the dierence in geological structure hinders its universality in 5 an expert system was proposed for earthquake prediction based on historical seismic events panakkat and adeli 6 conducted a large number of reviews in earthquake prediction in the past 15 years and divided the existing methods into two categories 1 researches on the seismic precursors analysis 2 researches based on analyzing historical seismic data in 2018 devries et al 7 introduced a deep learning scheme to discern criteria for predicting the location of aftershocks based on static stress jia et al 8 adopted information entropy prin ciple iep to predict mine earthquake however due to the insucient medium large seismic data these methods have poor performance for example the neural network and deep learning approaches require more training sets otherwise the prediction results will be unsatisfactory in an earthquake prediction system various anomalies will appear at dierent levels when the system enters an anomalous status and this process is similar to human immune system the danger theory is a method that distinguishes danger from nondanger it does not require training process and is skilled in nding anomalies through indicator changes hence it can be used to predict earthquake which is a task that lacking large and medium earthquake data 9 in 10 and 11 dendritic cell algorithm dca inspired approaches were introduced to predict earthquakes however the signals extraction process in these methods depended on articial experiments which inuences the performance of dca in earthquake prediction in 12 the concept of numerical dierentiation based dca was proposed and implemented to four uci datasets however since the rstorder numerical dierentiation is used to directly calculate changes the normal changes will also be extracted as danger signal in 12 which may aect the performance of dca therefore we present a secondorder numerical dierentiation approach to extract signals of dca and then the new version of nddca is adopted to do earthquake prediction in sichuan and surroundings in our research in the rst place the earthquake indicator system is collected from dierent level of features in seismic silence and activity period moreover the earthquake indicators are 232 wen zhou et al earthquake prediction model based on danger theory in   converted into the input signals in nddca through numerical dierentiation in the end we predict whether there will be an earthquake with a magnitude higher than 45 in sichuan and surroundings during the following month the experiment in the paper is consistent with the earthquake prediction con ditions proposed by allen 13 1 a denite

haskell based deterministic dca hdca 11 negative selection algorithm nsa 14 back propagation neural network bpnn 15 and support vector machine svm the performance of these algorithms are evaluated by various machine learning and earthquake pre diction evaluation indicators 16 and the results depict that our approach yields better prediction accuracies the main contributions of our study are described as below  we present an architecture that combines a numerical dierentiation for sig nal extraction with dca that performs anomaly detection then it is imple mented to earthquake prediction  when the rstorder numerical dierentiation is adopted to directly calculate changes the normal changes will also be extracted as danger signal in 12 which may aect the performance of dca therefore we present a second order numerical dierentiation to extract signals of dca  the seismic data for recent years in sichuan and surroundings are chosen to extract eight indicators by gutenbergritcher inverse powerlaw and seismic magnitude distribution for earthquake prediction  we apply nddca to earthquake prediction as far as the author knows it has not been implemented to do earthquake magnitudes prediction overall our algorithm yields the encouraging results in all qualied parameters assessed and it provides technical support for the application of earthquake prediction the remainder of the paper is arranged as follows the latest and most related work of earthquake magnitude prediction and dca are summarized in section 2 section 3 outlines the proposed approach to implement earthquake magnitude pre diction the data preprocess and prediction verication methods are demonstrated in section 4 section 5 addresses the experimental results and analysis section 6 describes the conclusions and future work 2 related work the articial intelligence inspired earthquake prediction methods mainly depend on historical seismic catalog or time series earthquake indicators so as to estab lish learning model to predict a future earthquake in 2007 the articial neural network was used to predict earthquakes in southern california 17 in 2007 a multilayer perceptron neural network was introduced to predict earthquakes based on the total electron content time series and it can detect changes in ionospheric 233 neural network world 42020 231247 variables that are considered as earthquake precursors 18 the earthquake mag nitude was predicted by adaptive neurofuzzy model using fuzzy subtractive clus tering 19 an adaptive neurofuzzy inference system was proposed for earthquake magnitude prediction in iran 20 the regression algorithm and cloudbased big data infrastructure were used for earthquake prediction in california within the next 7 days 21 in 2017 the imbalanced classiers and ensemble learning were used to do large earthquake magnitude prediction in chile 22 in 2015 for the expert system can provide the characteristics of exible and eective solutions to dierent problems the association rules were used for historical seismic data pro cessing and the expert systems based on association rules were applied to forecast the earthquake probability over the next 12 hours 5 huang et al 23 proposed a deep learning approach to predict continuous earthquake for current neural networks are prone to local minimum problems during the training phase some scholars use optimization algorithms such as genetic algorithms to optimize neural networks 62122 since sichuan is an earthquakeprone area scholars have also been involved in the study of sichuan earthquake a ground temperature sensor that implemented in the detection of earthquake precursors was designed by wang et al 24 the kohonen neural network was adopted to do distribution of aftershock prediction and implemented to 2008 sichuan earthquake 25 in 14 a negative selection algorithm was proposed for earthquake prediction to reduce the impact of lacking large earthquake data on the training performance when danger theory is applied to the eld of data mining the study of danger and nondanger discrimination is closely bound up with concentration of indica tors in most data mining systems it is important to dene and measure the correspondence between indicators and danger theory signals according to status transition process of dendritic cells in dangerous patterns greensmith 26 pro posed dca and implemented it to anomaly detection syn scanning intrusion detection and internet of things security dca belongs to the category of innate immune algorithm without the need of pattern matching and dynamic learning the current researches focus on the optimization of dca signal acquisition process and its application chelly and elouedi 27 have summarized that the dca data preprocessing methods including advantages and disadvantages of dierent versions of dca and their application areas this research team uses rough set theory as a data preprocess method of dca and applies it to solve the problem of binary classication the dca is used to do spam detection in 28 and it is also applied to load balancing in cloud computing in 29 since dca does not require a train ing process when performing anomaly detection it can solve the problem that the articial neural network requires a large number of training sets therefore gan et al 10 introduced the dca to predict an earthquake of magnitude greater than 45 in sichuan next month in 11 a haskell based deterministic dca is proposed to do earthquake prediction of sichuan and surroundings with magnitude greater than 45 in the next month in 12 since the changes described by numerical dierential can better reect the signal generation process in danger theory it is recommended to do signal mapping for dca and then the proposed nddca was implemented to classify standard uci wisconsin breast cancer dataset 234 wen zhou et al earthquake prediction model based on danger theory in   generally speaking an earthquake prediction method includes three steps ac quisition of seismic activity indicators establishment of prediction models and evaluation of prediction results nevertheless since the medium and large earth quake data is insucient the prediction accuracies are not ideal danger theory is an adaptive dynamic intelligent approach to do anomaly detection without was implemented data according to a large number of research activities in the last decade as far as the authors know the nddca has not been used to predict earth quakes hence this paper uses nddca to predict earthquakes in sichuan and surroundings 3 methodology an earthquake prediction model based on nddca eqpnddca is outlined in this section which transforms earthquake prediction into a binary classication problem based on machine learning approaches 31 seismic indicators the proposed earthquake prediction method is according to gr law and earth quake magnitude distribution 30 this

sichuan china and surroundings are chosen as experimental data red circle which is acquired from the earthquake catalog of china earthquake network center cenc and it pro vides historical seismic data for the proposed eqpnddca as can be seen from fig 1 the historical seismic data includes ve features event data time latitude longitude and magnitude and each data is denoted as e  e1     ei     em then the gr law is adopted to calculate seismic indicator matrix f which is de scribed in section 31 four indicators are according to gr law blue rectangle and others are not related to the assumed temporal distribution of earthquake magni tude pink rectangle the class c for each event is denoted as c  0 1 and it is dened as eq 2 according to 31 where c is equal to 1 if the largest magnitude of an event occurring within the prediction range is greater than or equal to ms otherwise c  0  is the event number that occurred in the catalog within the prediction range according to 15 since the prediction horizon is related to the calculation of seismicity indicators the prediction horizon is set as one month to evaluate the seismic indicators for a specic event ei the previous n events are cal culated and the n is set to 100 15 in this paper the proposed eqpnddca has been compared to six stateofart approaches dca hdca nsa svm knn and bpnn and some statistical indicators are introduced to evaluate the performance of these algorithms ci   1 if maxmj  i  j  i    ms 0 otherwise 2 33 danger theory based earthquake prediction model the dca is a danger theory inspired algorithm immature

cytokines concentration the mature context indicates danger and semimature context indicates safe dc context determines safe or danger sta tus of all antigens which are presented by the dc for each antigen the times it has presented in mature or semimature context can be used to decide whether the antigen is normal or anomalous and this value is dened as mature context antigen value mcav a higher mcav represents that the antigen is anomalous whereas the antigen is safe and the anomalous threshold is usually determined by the application environment for the signal acquisition of the original dca does not realize the dynamics of dc the nddca is proposed to realize the purpose of signals acquisition dynamically 12 fig 2 describes the architecture of the fig 2 the proposed eqpnddca

to pamp ds ss and ic signals by the secondorder numerical dierentiation on the basis of the method nddca ds denotes high possibility of earthquake occurring pamp indicates that there are abnormal indicators and earthquake activity is strong ss indicates that the probability of normal is relatively high namely earthquake activ ity is weak ic is to amplify other signals the rstorder numerical dierentiation represents the change between discrete data 12 and the secondorder numeri cal dierentiation introduced in this paper is based on the rstorder numerical dierentiation if only the rstorder numerical dierentiation is used to directly calculate the change the normal change will also be extracted as a danger signal therefore it is necessary to introduce the secondorder numerical dierentiation to distinguish whether the change represented by the rstorder numerical dier entiation is anomalous as the basis for signal extraction suppose the indicator set is dened as i  x1     xi

data in sichuan and surroundings the decisive characteristics of earthquakes are collected as an indicator system then the mapping of character 240 wen zhou et al earthquake prediction model based on danger theory in   istic vector pamp ss ds and ic signals are established and the weight matrix of nddca is dened nally we use nddca to do earthquake prediction 34 model parameters the eqpnddca has been compared to three articial immune algorithms dca hdca nsa and three stateofart machine learning methods bpnn svm and knn the proposed approach dca and hdca use pca as the signal extraction method in dca inspired algorithms dc poll number is 100 and the anomalous threshold is set as a random number between 0 and 1 the danger threshold  in our eqpnddca is set to 05 in nsa the detector radius is set to 02 in knn k is 1 the euclidean distance and linear search of neighbors are adopted the svm employs a sequential minimal optimization method the complexity parameter is 1 and it uses a polynomial kernel of exponent 1 the bpnn includes three layers therein the learning rate is set to 00003 the number of training epochs is 100 and the standard gradient descent is used as weight learning method 4 example applications 41 data preprocess the seismic information of sichuan and surroundings is intercepted from january 1 1990 to february 28 2020 in our research we select 12306

087 053 067 017 063 tab viii comparison of experimental results in ds2 referring to ds1 see tab vii we can nd that for the r score the eqp nddca is the highest among the seven classiers followed by dca the highest auc of eqpnddca indicates that it is the best classication algorithm for ds1 meanwhile the mcc has obvious advantages compared with nsa hdca svm knn and bpnn which also shows that the compared methods are not suitable for this dataset the experimental results in tab viii show that the proposed approach has the highest r score and it is a very satisfactory evaluation indicator in a seismic prediction system meanwhile the evaluation indicators of hdca are also not bad however the r score of knn is 017 which depicts that it is not suitable for the dataset tab ix demonstrates the experimental results of ds3 from which it can be seen that the r score and avg of the proposed algorithm provide better results 243 neural network world 42020 231247 eqp nddca dca hdca nsa svm knn

also do not nd any false positive namely all the data are labeled as positive therefore the result cannot be considered the experimental results in tab x depicts that the mcc dierence between eqpnddca and the compared approaches is obvious producing a dierence greater than 013 units with the suboptimal classier hdca however the r scores of eqpnddca and bpnn are the same which indicates that bpnn is also suitable for predicting earthquakes in ds4 eqp nddca dca hdca nsa svm knn bpnn ppv 091 043 083 053 034 000 078 npv 089 052 078 061 053 063 079 rn 088 048 081 049 069 000 095 s 075 059 075 057 080

results in ds4 through the combination analysis of tab viix we can nd that for most datasets eqpnddca has the highest r score and avg value therefore we can conclude that eqpnddca is the most suitable classier for these datasets nev ertheless since almost all forecasts have too much true positive we still have a lot of work to be improved since avg is a comprehensive manifestation of ppv npv rn and s our paper concludes by observing the avg of datasets ds1ds4 in fig 3 and it shows that the avg of eqpnddca are better the second best algorithm is hdca but the result has high variability making this algorithm an unstable method and may not be an estimated method for future work in the 244 wen zhou et al earthquake prediction model based on danger theory in   fig 3 the avg between eqpnddca and other algorithms end the methods with worst results are svm and knn which have an average accuracy less than 50  from tab viix and fig 3 we can nd that the performance of eqpnddca in dataset ds2 and ds4 are better than ds1 and ds3 the reason is that the standard deviation of magnitudes of ds2 and ds4 are higher than that of ds1 and ds3 which can be easily nd in tab iv and it makes numerical dierentiation has better results in signal extraction so as to improve the prediction accuracies of eqpnddca 6 conclusion and future work since the inuence of many variables in earthquake magnitude prediction has not been fully understood it is also a very complicated problem to the best of au thors knowledge the danger theory inspired nddca has not been introduced to do earthquake prediction although it is an ecacious classication method in com puter safety image recognition and etc in our study the nddca in the danger theory is rstly adopted to do earthquake prediction and the earthquake indicators are acquired by gr law and earthquake magnitude distribution for danger theory has characteristics of dynamic and requires no training samples which guarantee the optimization of the danger theory model and make it suitable to predict earthquakes the 12306 samples with a magnitude greater than 30 in sichuan and sur roundings are selected as experimental dataset according to the experiments in ds1 ds2 ds3 and ds4 since the most r score and avg values for eqpnddca are better than that for other compared algorithms we conclude that the proposed approach has the best prediction accuracy compared to the other six machine learning algorithms dca hdca nsa bpnn knn and svm nevertheless 245 neural network world 42020 231247 the proposed eqpnddca has a lack of selfadaptive characteristics regarding the impact of seismic indicators on the eqpnddca the future work is to start from this point acknowledgement the authors want to thank nsfc httpwwwnsfcgovcn for the support

sus numerosas reimpresiones su cuerpo histrico de 72 volmenes y 10 apndices nuestra investigacin demuestra que esto no puede ser cierto el hallazgo en google books de una entrada enciclopdica del

discordancia motiva esta investigacin en la que entre otros motivos de desavenencia se descubre que jph haba presentado una denuncia contra la empresa editorial por piratera intelectual el enfrentamiento acab en una denuncia contra jph por chantaje y provoc su correspondiente desenciclopedizacin el borrado del espasa oscureci el prestigio de jph como literato y ensombreci su importante

hervs jph encontramos un ejemplo incontestable de ello en el transcurso de esta investigacin llevada a cabo por los autores y que de forma particular se integra en la redaccin de la tesis doctoral de la autora jos prez hervs escritor traductor y lexicgrafo se descubri que el personaje estudiado era vctima de un forzado olvido que haba que achacar en buena medida a un intento de borrado y ocultacin de su persona por parte de la influyente industria editorial y del que alevosamente fue cmplice el poder poltico dominante tras la guerra civil espaola la suerte y el destino han hecho que prez hervs salga a flote en lo que puede considerarse tanto un acto de supervivencia como de justicia el hecho casual de encontrar en google books una entrada dedicada a jos prez hervs en la enciclopedia universal ilustrada europeoamericana o espasa tomo 43 pgina 727 1921 propicia esta contribucin la aparente intrascendencia del hallazgo fue para los que esto firman motivo de asombro pues anteriormente se haba comprobado que tal entrada no exista en la enciclopedia no se tiene constancia de que se hayan publicado dos espasas sino de lo opuesto hay reconocidas referencias que afirman expresamente que la modificacin del cuerpo principal de la obra desvirtuara el espritu de la monumental enciclopedia que se jacta en su propaganda de no haber cambiado jams el cuerpo histrico de la obra entindase los primeros 70 tomos 72 volmenes ms diez apndices segn se lee en castellano 2000 538 quien pasa por ser posiblemente el autor que mejor conoce la enciclopedia la fijeza de la forma de

nica de hecho si se pide una copia de la pgina 727 nunca hay forma de saber con anticipacin si contiene o no a prez hervs hasta dnde llegar la interiorizacin de tener el cuerpo principal inalterado que la misma biblioteca nacional de espaa bne no tiene la precaucin de mantener en sus estanteras el espasa en juegos completos esto es con tomos de una misma hornada y este comentario no es balad porque todas las colecciones de las salas de consulta estn confeccionadas de retales o remiendos las pginas del espasa con las que se trabaj originalmente provenan de la universidad de stanford que result ser una de las que encontramos con la entrada de prez hervs edicin que se corresponde con la publicada en la preguerra y que vamos a llamar perezhervasiana aunque no tenemos constancia de cuntas copias pueda haber de las versiones alteradas en estados unidos s podemos decir que la catalogacin es imprecisa en la mayora de las bibliotecas empezando por las del congreso y harvard hemos

copias de la edicin de preguerra si contamos con que se tiraron diecisiete mil fascculos de ella castellano 2000 142 el siguiente comentario tomado de fernndez fuentes 2007 29 pasa a tener un diferente sentido a la luz de nuestra investigacin en cuanto a la importancia de la obra espasa en la actualidad hay que decir que todos los catlogos de bibliotecas nacionales y universitarias consultados para la realizacin de este trabajo cuentan al menos con un ejemplar de la obra estas consultas realizadas en los catlogos en lnea en internet incluyen las bibliotecas nacionales europeas algunas orientales y las bibliotecas universitarias de facultades de historia arte literatura ciencias de la informacin y documentacin de espaa francia alemania italia y estados unidos nfasis aadido se estar refiriendo la autora a la obra alterada de la posguerra lo cierto es que no se sabe de cul es de la que se habla hay que hacer notar que los bibliotecarios de la misma bne fueron los primeros extraados al tener conocimiento de la manipulacin de los contenidos tampoco se tena memoria de que la propia bne en la ficha de registro de catlogo ahi18343 en el apartado edicin e ha biblio se dice en las sucesivas reimpresiones de la obra algunos volmenes tienen modificaciones en el contenido lo que no se aclara sin embargo es qu reimpresiones qu contenidos qu volmenes o qu supresiones fueron las que se efectuaron lo que se ha verificado es que el tomo 43 de la coleccin consultada en la sala de informacin bibliogrfica no contiene la entrada de prez hervs ahondando ms en la misma circunstancia se lee en fernndez fuentes 2007 4142 citando a snchez vigil 2006 en esa fecha 1923 se encarg a dionisio prez la revisin de las voces de los tomos ya publicados para organizar un fichero de erratas cambios y aadidos con vistas a los futuros apndices nfasis aadido en ningn momento se habla de querer reformar el cuerpo principal de la obra y s en cambio se 487 estudios de lingstica del

prez hervs es de 1921 anterior al encargo el artculo enciclopedia universal ilustrada europeoamericana de wikipedia menciona explcitamente la existencia de cambios pero no queda claro si las revisiones corresponden al cuerpo central a los apndices o a los suplementos de posguerra only minor revisions have been made to the original volumes such as the rewrite of a part of the 1910 bicicleta article which had enumerated a pistol or revolver as one of the things to be taken on a bycicle tour nfasis aadido encontramos en bueno snchez 2004 la misma insistencia llegando a hablarse de copias facsimilares de esta forma la nueva enciclopedia universal ilustrada queda configurada en dos bloques dispares en su extensin y su naturaleza pero absolutamente homogneos en cuanto a su forma y criterios expositivos el primer bloque comprende el cuerpo de la obra o enciclopedia histrica as como el primer apndice con sus ochenta tomos en ochenta y dos volmenes que se conserva ntegro respetando su forma original casi a la manera de una edicin facsimilar nfasis aadido otros cambios conocidos afectarn nicamente al maquillaje general de la obra y solo en sus suplementos hablamos de los casos poco pregonados de la desespaolizacin de nombres de pila y lugares geogrficos provenientes de lenguas extranjeras por ejemplo shakespeare aparece como guillermo en la edicin histrica y como william en los apndices posteriores 19352005 de gran trascendencia para los futuros estudios de la enciclopedia ser el averiguar si ste es un caso de borrado nico o si hay otros de este mismo porte censuril hay que aclarar que el caso de prez hervs no es el de una censura anterior a la publicacin l mismo habla en espakalpe de redactores cuyos datos no se actualizaron en los apndices segn cuenta a causa de la envidia del redactor encargado de la seccin de biografa por citar alguno telesforo de aranzadi casimiro brugus wifredo coroleu enrique massager y serra hunter el responsable de las biografas parece ser que era toms orts climent que quede para la posteridad jph 1935 128 el reconocimiento de la existencia de dos espasas una histrica y una modificada tiene como efecto inmediato relativizar todo trabajo hecho hasta la fecha sobre la obra desde ahora las reimpresiones deben pasar a ser consideradas reimpresiones s pero de una reelaboracin totalmente imprevisible el hallazgo de la entrada de prez hervs abre la puerta no solo a revitalizar trabajos anteriores sino tambin a realizar nuevas investigaciones ya que si se tratara de una censura aislada no cambiara mucho la enciclopedia pero en caso de que se est ante una censura orquestada entonces las circunstancias de la guerra quizs tambin hayan propiciado otras posibles desenciclopedizaciones pasemos a jos prez

ediciones modificadas todo trabajo con informacin detallada sobre las ilustraciones debe incluir el ao del tomo de referencia cf snchez vigil 2005 por poner ejemplos convincentes el tomo 43 de 1921

used to treat malaria and its symptoms the aim is to reveal the large number of antimalarial araceae species used worldwide and their great unexplored potential as sources of antimalarial natural products the scifinder scholar scielo pubmed sciencedirect and google books search engines were consulted fortythree records of 36 species and 23 genera of araceae used for malaria and symptoms treatment were found the neotropical genera philodendron schott and anthurium schott were the best represented for the use in the treatment of malaria fevers liver problems and headaches leaves and tubers were the most used parts and decoction was the most common preparation method the extracts of araceae species inhibit the in vitro growth of the human malaria parasite the plasmodium falciparum

headaches vomiting and chills that appear 1015 days after infection who 2014 despite advances in its control and prevention in the past decade malaria continues to be one of the worlds major transmissible diseases it is responsible for high mortality in tropical and subtropical regions of the planet muoz et al 2000 adebayo  krettli 2011 tsabang et al 2011 several factors contribute to the unacceptably high malaria morbidity and mortality rates the major human malaria parasites plasmodium falciparum welch and p vivax grassi  feletti are acquiring resistance to the most important drugs the quinoline antimalarials and artemisinin derivatives also many ecosystems favor the ready reproduction and propagation of malaria vectors mosquitos of the genus anopheles meigen in tropical regions where malaria is endemic alternative therapies based on traditionally used antimalarial plants are used milliken 1997a willcox et al 2004 blair  madrigal 2005 new drugs introduced into the therapeutic arsenal are mostly derived from natural products newman  cragg 2012 plants provide secondary metabolites that are useful for the treatment of protozoan diseases such as malaria pohlit et al 2013 leishmaniasis and african and american trypanosomiasis schmidt et al 2012a 2012b in fact traditionallyused antimalarial plants are the origin of the alkaloid quinine isolated from species of cinchona  and the sesquiterpene artemisinin isolated from artemisia annua l that gave rise last century to the synthetic quinoline antimalarials chloroquine etc and semisynthetic artemisinin derivatives sodium artesunate etc these two classes are the basis of artemisinincombined therapies acts now used worldwide plants also help combat malaria by providing mosquito repellent and insecticidal oils citronella neem etc solvent extracts and isolated chemicals chrysanthamic acid nicotine etc that have given rise to the pyrethroid neonicotinoid and other insecticides and repellents pohlit et al 2011a 2011b the

da esquizofrenia para freud a psicose  a criao de outra realidade e para bleuler importante psiquiatra suo devido a suas contribuies para o entendimento da esquizofrenia o indivduo se restringia a um mundo prprio e tinha uma perda de contato com a realidade e isto ele chamou de autismo correlacionando as falas de freud e bleuler percebese que nenhum dos dois afirma que o autista tem uma perda total da realidade s h a prevalncia maior do mundo restrito deles do que ao mundo da relao com os demais seres humanos mas o autismo desvinculado da esquizofrenia surge somente em 1943 nomeado como

auditiva mas 2018 estes testes trouxeram dados de nveis baixos de inteligncia da falta de reaes a estmulos sonoros ou uma resposta mais limitada que fomentava e reafirmava o diagnstico de surdez mas

nixon west lafayette in purdue university press127144 introduction academic librarians have planned for experimented with and generally been waiting for the ebook revolution as a solution to many library challenges and for the advantages the ebook provides to users unlike its print counterpart an ebook can never be lost markedup or worn out it does not take up any shelf space so saves the overhead on the building it does not require a staff member or selfcheck kiosk to check it out or to check it back into the library student assistants are not needed to re shelve it or to make sure it is on the right shelf and in the right order just the savings in staff time of scanning the bar codes for an inventory and reshelving the misshelved books make ebooks very attractive to librarians another advantage is that librarians do not even need to purchase ebooks before users begin to check them out instead they can load the catalog records into the online catalog and wait to see which books are borrowed then pay after there has been demonstrated use the ebook has great advantages for the users also in many cases an ebook can be checked out by multiple users at the same time and is available wherever and whenever the user needs it however perhaps the most valuable advantage is that every single word and phrase in an ebook is searchable indexing systems library online catalogs and search engines like google books now help users find or discover the content inside ebooks the reader does not need to know which book has the information needed instead he can use a search engine and go to the exact page and sentence with a few clicks with so many advantages it seems logical that librarians would be eager to switch from purchasing books in print to embrace the electronic format however the transition to ebooks in academic libraries has not been a smooth or quick one and the reasons are myriad and complicated aware that this is still a time of transition and that there are many issues surrounding the ebook the editors set out to present the state of ebooks in academic libraries today they invited knowledgeable publishers and librarians to write about the current challenges successes and trends in addition there is a section that analyzes new data about user interaction with ebooks and an essay written by a teaching faculty member who uses and encourages her student to use e books literature review to set the stage a literature review is in order to identify the challenges facing the ebook revolution the major problems can be summed up in two statements 1 lack of sufficient content and 2 users stated preference for printed books in many cases although time will eventually solve the lack of content problem librarians still face the issue that many users prefer printed books the reasons for this preference are complicated but the literature suggests that the primary reason is that indepth reading of an ebook is difficult partly because of poor interfaces but primarily because the e book is not a printed book background on ebooks and ereaders some writers trace the origins of the ebook back to the 1940s ebook in wikipedia the free encyclopedia p 10 but the current ebook as we know it today defined as a booklength publication in digital form that must be read on some computer device can be traced to project gutenberg founded in 1971 by michael s hart and now a collection of nearly 50000 books project gutenberg in wikipedia the free encyclopedia p 1 ebooks did not become an option for library purchase until 1997 with ebrary and in 1999 with netlibrary safari and springerlink and ebook library ebl appeared between 2001 and 2004 in late 2004 google began digitizing books from new york public library and several other major academic libraries this project now known as google books provides bibliographic information on copyrighted books and full views and downloads of books no longer protected by copyright laws for a detailed discussion of this history see the article by connaway and wicht 2007 and zeoli 2013 during these early years patrons read ebooks on their personal computers but with the invention of ereaders a major change occurred ebooks became easier to read an early but unsuccessful ereader came on the market in 1998 the rocket ebook but the major turning point date is 20042006 when the sony librie and the sony reader were introduced the sony ereaders were followed quickly in 2007 by amazons kindle and in 2010 by apples ipad a tablet computer that can be used as an ereader with the widespread availability of affordable ereaders and tablets the sale of ebooks especially on the consumer market took off it is estimated that half of us adults own an ereader or a tablet zickurh  rainie 2014 jan 16 complication 1 lack of content statistics on size of ebook collections in academic libraries indicate lack of content given the advantages of ebooks and the high use of them that libraries report it is not surprising that academic libraries are increasing the percentage of their budget allocated to ebooks over 65 of most academic library budgets are spent on journals with about 25 spent on books the 2010 ithaka sr library survey asked library directors about their anticipated changes in the book budget allocation respondents predicted a steady shift towards digital materials over the next five years they reported that 6 of their materials budgets will be shifted from print books to electronic books bringing books expenditures in five years to 46 digital and 54 print long  schonfeld 2010 p 28 other studies show similar increases the 2012 library journal survey found that 95 of the academic libraries surveyed carry e books this figure has been constant for three years but the total number of ebooks offered increased 41 between 2011 and 2012 in libraries that support graduate programs this represented an increase from an average of 97500 to 138800 ebooks per library academic spending on ebooks increased from 75 of the total acquisition budget to 96 and libraries anticipate that this percentage will continue to increase 2012 ebook usage in us academic libraries third annual survey 2012 pp 56 these statistics indicate that libraries with a few rare exceptions1 are increasing digital 1  however there are a few academic libraries that have switched fully or almost fully to digital only the university of california merced campus is the prime example it opened in september of 2005 with only ten print journal subscriptions compared to 15000 online journals and the history ebook collection now the humanities e book collection ebrary and netlibrary they started a pda program with ebook library ebl and couttsmyilibrary and several publisher packages overall 83 of their collection was electronic in 2007 dooley 2007 p 24 by 2010 the library had 800000 records in the catalog approximately 88 were electronic dooley 2011 p 118 another bookless satellite library opened in 2010 at the university of texas at san antonio the applied engineering and technology library kemp lutz  nurnberger 2012 monograph percentages and numbers but the ebook is not replacing the printed book completely the vast majority of academic libraries continue to purchase both print and electronic books the balance may be approaching half print and half electronic but libraries have not transitioned to primarily electronic for books as they have for journals part of the explanation for slow adoption is because many publishers have been hesitant to produce and then sell libraries the majority of their listings as ebooks especially unlimited use ebooks many current titles are often either not published in electronic format or the publisher delays the ebook format until the printed version achieves market saturation some publishers fear loss of revenue if the printed edition is not the exclusive format available at least for the first few critical months hodges preston  hamilton 2010 p 198 another issue is that publishers are sometimes slow to offer their backlists in eformat since librarians cannot afford to buy many titles in both formats they often feel that they must choose between buying the print version upon publication or making their patrons wait often for months before the ebook edition appears for a detailed discussion of the issues see the william h walters article 2013 just as library budget statistics show this print priority so do market statistics ybp handles 85 of englishlanguage books sold to academic libraries in the us and canada and is in the position to compile statistics on book sales in september 2013 michael zeoli 2013 of ybp reported that only 15 of ybps book sales are for e books with 85 of the sales still of printed books p 7 comparing this statistic with the one in the library journal survey for the same year indicates that although many of the ebooks in libraries come from large publisher or vendor packages and are thus not reflected in the ybp statistic libraries still buy printed books on an encouraging note ybp also has seen the simultaneous publication of print and electronic books move to 40 or nearly 10000 books per week p 9 even with this change in the ebook market zeoli found that only 25 of the 1400 publishers that ybp represents make over 10 of their content available in digital format p 10 understanding the state of the ebook market compared to printed books explains why libraries continue to buy printed books and why librarians often comment that there is not sufficient econtent available users cite lack of content in many studies users also identify the problem of lack of content in the 2012 ithaka s r us faculty survey users placed the highest need on access to a wider range of materials in digital format housewright schonfeld  wulfson 2013 p 33 in a detailed study at laurentian university over a nineyear period lamothe 2013 found a relationship between the size of the ebook collection and its use he wrote that the level of usage appeared to be directly proportional to the size of the collection in other words increasing the amount of content directly increases the use of the collection p 44 during a study of circulation of ereaders at the bookless satellite library for applied engineering and technology at the university of texas at san antonio library the first problem that users cited was limited selection of content textbooks in particular were unavailable of the 25 textbooks titles in use by more than 500 engineering students none was available on an ereader platform kemp et al 2012 p 194 the jisc national ebook observatory on the perspective of ebook users on ebooks the largest survey conducted with over 20000 staff and students participating asked users the advantages of ebooks clearly these users found online access the most important advantage however very low on their list of advantages was wider choice thereby identifying lack of content as an issue jamali nicholas  rowlands 2009 p 39 libraries have many ways to buy ebooks but sufficient content is still a problem part of the problem is that purchasing ebooks is complicated and time consuming several ebook acquisition models have been tried and adapted over the past ten or fifteen years yet the industry is still in a state of transition libraries have several options available and new methods become available frequently one method is to buy directly from a publisher or libraries can purchase through vendors such as ybp or coutts usually the access to these ebooks is limited to the students and staff at the institution although some libraries have successfully acquired ebooks through consortial purchases2 whether a library buys from a publisher aggregator or vendor it has options such as selecting titlebytitle setting up approval plans automatic purchasing of whole subject categories setting up delayed payment plans patrondriven or demanddriven acquisition or buying bundles a bundle or package of titles usually contains a substantial portion of the publishers titles at an extremely advantageous price per title examples of publishers that offer these bundles are springer brill elsevier and wiley similar package options are available from aggregators like jstor and project muse 2 one example is the scholars portal books locally built platform for university libraries in ontario canada horava 2013 other examples include california state university library consortia shepherd  langston 2013 and triangle research libraries network which includes duke north carolina central north carolina state and university of north carolina lippincott et al 2012 and e orbis cascade alliance a consortium of thirtysix academic libraries in oregon and washington hinken  mcelroy 2011 both of whom offer ebooks from many publishers other aggregators offer subscription models with thousands of titles from many publishers the advantage of buying or subscribing to a large ebook package is that the library adds a large corpus of ebooks however although the pertitle price is usually attractive the total package may be high and often only a fairly small percentage of the titles receive significant use in addition to these choices when librarians buy ebooks they purchase only the access rights to the titles and those rights vary by publisher or vendor and by the license that the library signs with the provider rights variables include the total number of simultaneous users and the amount of a title that can be downloaded or printed the digital rights management drm restrictions indicate whether or not a library can provide chapters to resource sharing partners until recently the ability to lend the entire contents of an ebook was impossible complication 2 users say they prefer printed books a more complicated issue to solve is users preference for print lack of sufficient content in electronic format is an issue that will be resolved in time as more publishers attitude to ebooks change and as more books are published in eformat especially earlier in their life cycle however user preferences are more difficult to understand and to study and therefore to address and change librarians like ebooks because they solve many of the librarys longterm logistic problems eg shelving checking in and out shelfreading and replacing lost or worn out volumes however users like printed books this sentiment is clearly stated in polankas book no shelf required 2 2012 ed the text which follows is a block quote perhaps most important for this chapter however ebooks suffer from simply not being print books people like print books they like the way they smell and feel how they give libraries a sense of gravitas and how they present a physical embodiment of scholarship and creativity people rally around print books it is difficult to imagine ebooks inspiring the same level of loyalty when newport beach library system in california announced this march that they were looking into changing one of their branch libraries into a primarily digital space there was an immediate uproar p 5 user reluctance to use ebooks but statistics show high use users are reluctant to adopt the ebook unilaterally often telling librarians that the want a real book for example a large international study done by ebrary and uk national ebooks observatory in 2008 found that one of the reasons for never using e books was preference for print ebrary 2008 the librarians at the university of california conducted a study of springer books important in part because of its size this study found that 49 of those surveyed preferred printed books while 34 preferred ebooks and 17 had no preference preference for the electronic book is highest among postdocs followed by graduate students then undergraduates with faculty being the least interested in ebooks li poe potter quigley  wilson 2011 pp 4 11 a recent annual study also confirms this user preference the 2012 ebook usage in us academic libraries found that the statistic on preference for print was climbing not declining in 2010 40 of those surveyed said they preferred print in 2012 50 stated preference for print 2012 ebook usage in us academic libraries third annual survey 2012 p 8 studies indicate an acceptance of ebooks despite the fact that users state a preference for the printed book levineclark 2006 surveyed university of denver users in 2005 and even though more than 60 indicated a preference for print more than 80 indicated some flexibility between the two formats p 292 in a study published in 2009 participants were asked to indicate what book format  electronic or print  they thought they would be using only 11 percent indicated that they would mostly be reading electronic books and 26 indicated mostly print 56 indicated that they believed they would be reading a combination of formats shelburne 2009 p 65 for other examples see the literature review in smyths and carlins article 2012 use and perception of ebooks in the university of ulster a case study statistical studies indicate extremely high use of the electronic version even when a printed version is available examples include the connaway 2002 study at the university of pittsburgh using netlibrary titles this study showed that ebooks were used 37 times compared to 17 circulations of the same title in print p 22 the littman and connaway 2004 study also confirms heavier use of the ebook compared to its print equivalent this study compared nearly 8000 titles available in print and electronic format at duke university it found that ebooks were used 11 more than the print versions p 260 several other studies report similar findings it is difficult to understand users stated preference for print in light of the statistics that indicate higher use of the electronic do users say one thing but do something else or are they using ebooks in other ways this difference can be partially explained because users like to browse through ebooks and use the search feature to pinpoint the page or chapter they need if the book looks useful they might obtain a printed copy for indepth reading in some cases if a small portion of the book is sufficient the ebook may be all that is consulted in a study of over 1000 users at the university of denver levineclark 2006 found that 565 percent read a chapter or article within a book and 364 percent read a single entry or a few pages within a book but only 71 percent read the entire book italics added p 292 one study that demonstrates this dichotomy looked at undergraduates attitudes toward ebooks and found that 66 preferred the print format yet 89 said they would use an ebook if a printed copy was not available gregory 2008 p 269 another important study at the university of iowa compared usage of the same titles in both print and electronic format the authors concluded that users demonstrated a preference for the electronic this result conflicts with what users state as their preference this university of iowa study analyzed 850 ebooks purchased through a patrondriven acquisitions pda program during the study period the authors realized that 166 of the ebook titles were duplicated in print they compared usage of the print version with the electronic versions found a preference for the online version and concluded it is very apparent that the circulation of the print copy drops dramatically once the electronic version is available fischer wright clatanoff barton  shreeves 2012 p 480 research on use and reading of ebooks so how are ebooks being used users are interested in the very features that make it an ebook for example li and his colleagues li et al 2011 found that users placed highest value on the search capacities both within an ebook and across e books the ability to download the entire book something that can only be done with e books was also an important feature valued by these uses pp 1516 in the ithaka sr faculty survey 2012 70 of the respondents reported using scholarly monographs in digital form often or occasionally during the previous six months housewright et al 2013 p 31 although this high percentage seems in conflict with the stated preference for print the authors note that this is partially because there are many ways to use an ebook besides reading it scanning the table of contents reviewing the tables and figures searching the citations those surveyed indicated a preference for print or electronic depending on the activity p 32 in another study which used interviewing techniques with eight students at fujen catholic university in taiwan found that college students used different strategies when reading academic material as compared to leisure reading for example they first evaluate what they need to learn and allot reading time accordingly they also used more reread and elaborating and utilized the ebook features chanlin 2013 p 340 the authors concluded that the presentation and features of a scholarly ebook may need to differ from those of a leisure ebook for the consumer market p 342 another study done in australia also sheds some light on how users read ebooks this study used exploratory log analysis of ebook usage in an academic library and found that while strictly sequential reading in ebooks is hardly ever seen in this data set the trend with the exception of the large jumps back is generally to begin near the beginning of a book and work forwards mckay 2011 p 207 despite this trend readers moved back and forth through a document when reading closely p 207 corlettrivera and hackman 2014 surveyed liberal arts users at the university of maryland with the primary goal of understanding the gap between heavy use of ebooks and users preference for print one of their major findings was that the majority 52 indicate they do not download and nearly 75 say they never or rarely print portions of an ebook p 267 overall e reader ownership like the kindle had an important effect on preference 46 compared to 32 pp 270271 their finding about rarely printing is one that needs more research the shrimplin et al 2011 study found that users approach books differently depending on personal preferences these researchers categorized readers into four different groups book lovers who preferred print technophiles who preferred electronic formats pragmatists who use whatever format best suits their needs at the time and printers who print out electronic texts pp 185186 foasberg 2013 also studied when students prefer print or electronic she used a diary methodology and found that ereaders and tablets were used for nonacademic reading while paper printouts were nearly always used for academic reading 60 of the participants reading with a computer was not for class while 66 of their reading with print books was p 715 in sum readers search scan skip around and reread but generally they move forward they are more likely to read an ebook if they have an ereader or tablet but they prefer printed books for covertocover reading and for academic reading what ebooks to purchase early subject studies of ebooks in academic libraries despite users stated preference for print they consult the ebooks purchased by libraries one of the advantages of ebooks is that librarians can scrutinize data about usage that is far more detailed than circulation figures for print books librarians who were earlyadopters of ebooks naturally investigated what subject areas received the most use with the goal of then increasing purchases in highdemand subjects they anticipated that the answer would be computer science or the broader fields of science and technology and some early studies confirmed this christianson 2005 examined netlibrary usage during the 200203 school year for five academic institutions and found computers and specific sciences to be the most popular p 361 in a similar study littman and connaway 2004 at duke university found that their users favored ebooks about computers medicine and psychology p 260 dennis dillon 2001 at the university of texas austin conducted one early study of subject analysis of 20000 titles from three ebook collections although he reported heavier use in some subjects computer science economics and business there was sufficient use of all subjects to continue ebook purchases across all areas p 119 levine clarks 2007 study of humanists use of ebooks confirms this concept he found that  humanists tend to use ebooks at about the same rate as the rest of the campus community p 12 a question related to highuse subjects is whether librarians are selecting the books patrons want one way to study this is to compare books purchased based on patron demand with those selected by librarians in patrondemand ebook programs also called demanddriven dda or patrondriven acquisitions pda librarians load catalog records for books in profiled subjects and delay purchase until patrons make sufficient use of specific titles to warrant a purchase in these programs books are rented until a predetermined number of uses triggers a purchase jason price and john mcdonald 2009 compared librarianselected and patronselected ebl ebooks at five academic libraries from 2005 through 2009 the titles that the users selected were similar to those selected by librarians in four of the five libraries however the major finding of this early study of pda was that the userselected titles were used twice as often as librarianselected titles on average 86 times per year vs 43 times per year this study was very influential in promoting patrondriven acquisition models p 6 other studies have found similar results the ebooks patrons use are repeatedly chosen by other users diaz  fischer 2013 fischer et al 2012 stepping up to the challenge the editors believe that the library and scholarly publishing worlds stand in the crossroads for two major reasons first the increase in the size of ebook collections and second the widespread ownership of ereaders and tablets devices that make online reading a better experience more books than ever are being published simultaneously in print and electronic formats and publishers and aggregators offer new bundles or packages of thousands of titles to libraries at advantageous pertitle prices both of these events increase the availability of ebooks however the major influence on the number of ebooks available at any library is the patrondriven pda or demanddriven dda acquisitions model via pda librarians can offer an extremely large corpus of books far more than they could with either titlebytitle selection or bundle and then only buy the titles that patrons use students and researchers widespread use of ereaders and tablets may slowly change users attitudes toward ebooks people who enjoy leisure reading on their devices will eventually make the transition to reading professional and scholarly works on them as well in the past there was little information or research on how scholars read new research indicates that scholars scan skim skip around and reread in many cases they do not read a book from cover to cover but rather skim or skip to find relevant sections ereaders and tablets are ideal for this kind of perusal recent research indicates that scholars do not print chapters as librarians had thought they read on screen more and more frequently on handheld devicescorlettrivera  hackman 2014 finally ebooks especially on ereaders or tablets are very convenient scholars and students may prefer print but for convenience they use e format so why this collection of essays about a product that while no longer in its infancy is clearly still some distance from maturity in as few as five years the landscape may look very different it is precisely for this reason that the editors gathered this collection of essays about ebooks at this stage in their development this book provides a snapshot of both the ebook reality and its promise in the mid2010s the editors specifically excluded consideration of etextbooks since this particular topic introduces many specialized considerations beyond the scope of this book further the editors wanted to capture the viewpoints of all three major players for ebooks in libraries the producers and vendors the libraries and the users much of the library literature about ebooks to date has focused on the topic as it affects librarians and their users but seldom addresses the publishers and vendors perspective except to complain about perceived shortcomings the editors invited each of the chapter authors to write their essays carefully balancing contributions between all three perspectives for the case studies the editors issued a call for papers and selected seven of the 20 resulting proposals to represent the wide range of interesting projects that librarians are undertaking amongst the burgeoning array of collection development opportunities that ebooks offer suzanne m ward robert s freeman judith m nixon west lafayette in march 2015
